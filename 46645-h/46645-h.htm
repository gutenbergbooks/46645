<p>The marvel is, that at this date, these Englishmen were allowed to go to

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Robert Tomson</span>, born in the town of
Andover, in Hampshire, began his travels
out of England in the month of March,
<i>anno</i> 1553 [<i>i.e.</i>, 1554]; who departing out of
the city of Bristol in company of other
merchants of the said city, in a good ship
called the bark <i>Young</i>, within eight days
after, arrived at Lisbon, at Portugal: where
the said <span class="smcap">Robert Tomson</span> remained fifteen days. At the end
of which, he shipped himself for Spain in the said ship, and
within four days arrived in the bay of Cadiz in Andalusia, which
is under the kingdom of Spain: and from thence, travelled up
to the city of Seville by land, which is twenty leagues; and
there, he repaired to the house of one <span class="smcap">John Field</span>, an
English merchant who had dwelt in the said city of Seville
eighteen or twenty years married, with wife and children.
In whose house, the said <span class="smcap">Tomson</span> remained by the space of
one whole year or thereabout, for two causes: the one, to
learn the Castilian tongue; the other, to see the orders of
the country, and the customs of the people.</p>

<p>At the end of which time, having seen the fleets of ships
come out of the [West] Indies to that city, with such great
quantity of gold and silver, pearls, precious stones, sugar,
hides, ginger, and divers other rich commodities; he did
determine with himself to seek means and opportunity to
pass over to see that rich country, from whence such a great
quantity of rich commodities came.</p>

<p>And it fell out, that within short time after, the said <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Field</span>, where the said <span class="smcap">Tomson</span> was lodged, did determine to
pass over into the West Indies himself, with his wife, children,
and family: and, at the request of the said <span class="smcap">Tomson</span>, he
purchased a license of the King, to pass into the Indies, for
himself, wife, and children; and among them, also, for the said
<span class="smcap">Tomson</span> to pass with them. So that presently they made
preparation of victuals and other necessary provision for the
voyage. But the ships which were prepared to perform the
voyage being all ready to depart, were, upon certain considerations
by the King's commandment, stayed and arrested,
till further should be known of the King's pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon, the said <span class="smcap">John Field</span>, with his company and
<span class="smcap">Robert Tomson</span> (being departed out of Seville, and come
down to San Lucar de Barrameda, fifteen leagues off) seeing
the stay made upon the ships of the said fleet, and not being
assured when they would depart, determined to ship themselves
for the isles of the Canaries, which are 250 leagues
from San Lucar, and there to stay till the said fleet should
come hither; for that is continually their port to make stay
at, six or eight days, to take fresh water, bread, flesh, and
other necessaries.</p>

<p>So that in the month of February, in <i>anno</i> 1555, the said
<span class="smcap">Robert Tomson</span>, with the said <span class="smcap">John Field</span> and his company,
shipped themselves in a caravel of the city of Cadiz,
out of the town of San Lucar; and within six days, they
arrived at the port of the Grand Canary: where at our
coming, the ships that rode in the said port began to cry out
of all measure, with loud voices: insomuch that the Castle,
which stood fast by, began to shoot at us, and shot six or
eight shot at us, and struck down our mainmast before we
could hoist out our boat to go on land to know what the
cause of the shooting was; seeing that we were Spanish
ships, and coming into our country.</p>

<p>So that being on land, and complaining of the wrong and
damage done unto us; they answered that "they had thought
we had been French rovers, that had come into the said port
to do some harm to the ships that were there." For that
eight days past, there went out of the said port a caravel
much like unto ours, ladened with sugars and other merchandise
for Spain; and on the other side of the Point of the
said island, met with a French Man of War: which took the
said caravel, and unladed out of her into the said French
ship, both men and goods. And it being demanded of the
said Spaniards, "What other ships remained in the port
whence they came?"; they answered, "There remained
divers other ships, and one ladened with sugars as they
were, and ready to depart for Spain." Upon the which
news, the Frenchmen put thirty tall men of their ship, well
appointed, into the said caravel that they had taken, and
sent her back again to the said port from whence she had
departed the day before.</p>

<p>Somewhat late towards evening, she came into port, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
showing past three or four men, and so came to an anchor
hard by the other ships that were in the said port. Being
seen by the Castle and by the said ships, they made no
reckoning of her, because they knew her: and thinking that
she had found contrary winds at the sea, or having forgotten
something behind them, they had returned back again for the
same, they made no account of her, but let her alone riding
quietly among the other ships in the said port. So that
about midnight, the said caravel, with the Frenchmen in her,
went aboard [<i>touched</i>] the other ship that lay hard by, ladened
with sugars; and driving the Spaniards that were in her
under the hatches, presently let slip her cables and anchors,
and set sail and carried her clean away: and after this sort,
deceived them. And they thinking or fearing that we were
the like, did shoot at us as they did.</p>

<p>This being past: the next day after our arrival in the said
port, we did unbark ourselves, and went on land up to the
city or head town of the Grand Canaria, where we remained
eighteen or twenty days; and there found certain Englishmen,
merchants, servants of <span class="smcap">Anthony Hickman</span> and <span class="smcap">Edward</span>
<span class="smcap">Castelin</span>, merchants in the city of London, that lay there
for traffic: of whom we received great courtesy and much
good cheer.</p>

<p>After the which twenty days being past, in which we had
seen the country, the people, and the disposition thereof, we
departed from thence, and passed to the next isle of the
Canaries, eighteen leagues off, called Teneriffe; and being
come on land, went up to the city called La Laguna: where
we remained seven months, attending the coming of the
whole fleet, which, in the end, came; and there having
taken that which they had need of, we shipped ourselves in a
ship of Cadiz, being one of the said fleet, belonging to an
Englishman married in the city of Cadiz in Spain, whose
name was <span class="smcap">John Sweeting</span>. There came in the said ship as
Captain, an Englishman also, whose name was <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>
<span class="smcap">Chilton</span>, married in Cadiz, and son-in-law to the said <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Sweeting</span>: and another Englishman also, whose name was
<span class="smcap">Ralph Sarre</span>, came in the same ship, which had been a
merchant of the city of Exeter; one of fifty years of age or
thereabouts.</p>

<p>So that we departed from the said islands in the month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
October, the foresaid year [1555], eight ships in our company,
and so directed our course towards the Bay of New Spain
[<i>Gulf of Mexico</i>]; and, by the way, towards the island of
Santo Domingo, otherwise called Hispaniola: so that within
forty-two days [<i>i.e., in December</i>] after we departed from the
said islands of Canaries, we arrived with our ship at the
port of Santo Domingo; and went in over the bar, where our
ship knocked her keel at her entry. There our ship rid [<i>rode</i>]
before the town; where we went on land, and refreshed
ourselves sixteen days.</p>

<p>There we found no bread made of wheat, but biscuit
brought out of Spain, and out of the Bay of Mexico. For
the country itself doth yield no kind of grain to make bread
withal: but the bread they make there, is certain cakes made
of roots called <i>cassavia</i>; which is something substantial, but it
hath an unsavoury taste in the eating thereof. Flesh of beef
and mutton, they have great store; for there are men that
have 10,000 head of cattle, of oxen, bulls, and kine, which
they do keep only for the hides: for the quantity of flesh is
so great, that they are not able to spend the hundredth part.
Of hog's flesh is there good store, very sweet and savoury;
and so wholesome that they give it to sick folks to eat,
instead of hens and capons: although they have good store of
poultry of that sort, as also of guinea cocks and guinea hens.</p>

<p>At the time of our being there, the city of Santo Domingo
was not of above 500 households of Spaniards: but of the
Indians dwelling in the suburbs, there were more. The
country is, most part of the year, very hot: and very full of
a kind of flies or gnats with long bills [<i>mosquitos</i>], which do
prick and molest the people very much in the night when
they are asleep, in pricking their faces and hands and other
parts of their bodies that lie uncovered, and make them to
swell wonderfully. Also there is another kind of small worm,
which creepeth into the soles of men's feet, and especially of
the Black Moors [<i>Indians</i>] and children which use to go
barefoot, and maketh their feet to grow as big as a man's
head, and doth so ache that it would make one run mad.
They have no remedy for the same, but to open the flesh,
sometimes three or four inches, and so dig them out.</p>

<p>The country yieldeth great store of sugar, hides of oxen,
bulls and kine, ginger, <i>cana fistula</i>, and <i>salsaparilla</i>. Mines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of silver and gold there are none; but in some rivers, there
is found some small quantity of gold. The principal coin
that they do traffic withal in that place is black money, made
of copper and brass: and this they say they do use, not for
that they lack money of gold and silver to trade withal out
of the other parts of [West] India, but because, if they
should have good money, the merchants that deal with them
in trade would carry away their gold and silver, and let the
country commodities lie still. And thus much for Santo
Domingo. So we were, coming from the isles of Canaries
to Santo Domingo, and staying there, until the month of
December: which was three months.</p>

<p>About the beginning of January [1556], we departed thence
towards the Bay of Mexico and New Spain; towards which
we set our course, and so sailed twenty-four days, till we
came within fifteen leagues of San Juan de Ulua, which was
the port of Mexico of our right discharge.</p>

<p>And being so near our said port, there rose a storm of
northerly winds which came off from <i>Terra Florida</i>; which
caused us to cast about into the sea again, for fear lest that
night we should be cast upon the shore before day did break,
and so put ourselves in danger of casting away. The wind
and sea grew so foul and strong, that, within two hours after
the storm began, nine ships that were together, were so
dispersed, that we could not see one another.</p>

<p>One of the ships of our company, being of the burden of
500 tons, called the "Hulk of Carion," would not cast about
to sea, as we did; but went that night with the land:
thinking in the morning to purchase the port of San Juan
de Ulua; but missing the port, went with the shore, and was
cast away. There were drowned of that ship, seventy-five
persons, men, women, and children; and sixty-four were saved
that could swim, and had means to save themselves. Among
those that perished in that ship, was a gentleman who had
been Pres[id]ent the year before in Santo Domingo, his wife and
four daughters, with the rest of his servants and household.</p>

<p>We, with the other seven ships, cast about into the sea, the
storm [en]during ten days with great might, boisterous winds,
fogs, and rain. Our ship, being old and weak, was so tossed
that she opened at the stern a fathom under water, and the
best remedy we had was to stop it with beds and pilobiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
[? <i>pillows for litters</i>]: and for fear of sinking we threw and
lightened into the sea all the goods we had, or could come
by; but that would not serve.</p>

<p>Then we cut our mainmast, and threw all our ordnance
into the sea, saving one piece; which, early in a morning,
when we thought we should have sunk, we shot off: and, as
it pleased GOD, there was one of the ships of our company
near unto us, which we saw not by means of the great fog;
which hearing the sound of the piece, and understanding
some of the company to be in great extremity, began to make
towards us, and when they came within hearing of us, we
desired them "for the love of GOD! to help to save us, for
that we were all like to perish!" They willed us "to hoist
our foresail as much as we could, and make towards them;
for they would do their best to save us;" and so we did.</p>

<p>And we had no sooner hoisted our foresail, but there came
a gale of wind; and a piece of sea struck in the foresail, and
carried away sail and mast all overboard: so that then we
thought there was no hope of life. And then we began to
embrace one another, every man his friend, every wife her
husband, and the children their fathers and mothers; committing
our souls to Almighty GOD, thinking never to escape
alive. Yet it pleased GOD, in the time of most need, when
all hope was past, to aid us with His helping hand, and
caused the wind a little to cease; so that within two hours
after, the other ship was able to come aboard us, and took
into her, with her boat, man, woman and child, naked without
hose, or shoes upon many of our feet.</p>

<p>I do remember that the last person that came out of the
ship into the boat was a woman Black Moore [<i>Indian</i>]; who
leaping out of the ship into the boat, with a young sucking
child in her arms, leapt too short, and fell into the sea, and
was a good while under the water before the boat could come
to rescue her: and, with the spreading of her clothes rose
above water again, and was caught by the coat and pulled
into the boat, having still her child under her arm, both of
them half drowned; and yet her natural love towards her
child would not let her let the child go. And when she came
aboard the boat, she held her child so fast under her arm
still, that two men were scant able to get it out.</p>

<p>So we departed out of our ship, and left it in the sea. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
was worth 400,000 ducats [= <i>about</i> &pound;100,000 <i>then = about</i>
&pound;900,000 <i>now</i>], ship and goods, when we left it.</p>

<p>Within three days after, we arrived at our port of San Juan
de Ulua, in New Spain.</p>

<p>I do remember that in the great and boisterous storm of
this foul weather, in the night there came upon the top of
our mainyard and mainmast, a certain little light, much like
unto the light of a little candle, which the Spaniards called
the <i>corpos sancto</i>, and said "It was Saint <span class="smcap">Elmo</span>" [<i>see Vol. III.</i>
<i>p. 417</i>], whom they take to be the advocate of sailors. At which
sight, the Spaniards fell down upon their knees and worshipped
it: praying GOD and Saint <span class="smcap">Elmo</span> to cease the
torment, and save them from the peril they were in; with
promising him that, on their coming on land, they would repair
unto his chapel, and there cause masses to be said, and other
ceremonies to be done. The friars [did] cast relics into the
sea, to cause the sea to be still, and likewise said <i>Gospels</i>,
with other crossings and ceremonies upon the sea to make
the storm to cease: which, as they said, did much good to
weaken the fury of the storm. But I could not perceive it,
nor gave any credit to it; till it pleased GOD to send us the
remedy, and delivered us from the rage of the same. His
name be praised therefore!</p>

<p>This light continued aboard our ship about three hours,
flying from mast to mast, and from top to top; and sometimes
it would be in two or three places at once. I informed myself
of learned men afterward, what this light should be? and they
said that "It was but a congelation of the wind and vapours
of the sea congealed with the extremity of the weather, and
so flying in the wind, many times doth chance to hit the
masts and shrouds of the ship that are at sea in foul weather."
And, in truth, I do take it to be so: for that I have seen the
like in other ships at sea, and in sundry ships at once. By
this, men may see how the Papists are given to believe and
worship such vain things and toys as God; to whom all
honour doth appertain: and in their need and necessities do
let [<i>cease</i>] to call upon the living GOD, who is the giver of
all good things.</p>

<p>The 16th of April in <i>anno</i> 1556, we arrived at the port of
San Juan de Ulua in New Spain, very naked and distressed
of apparel and all other things, by means of the loss of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
foresaid ship and goods; and from thence we went to the
new town called Vera Cruz, five leagues from the said port
of San Juan de Ulua, marching still by the sea shore: where
we found lying upon the sands a great quantity of mighty
great trees, with roots and all, some of them four, five, or six
cart load, by estimation; which, as the people told us, were, in
the great stormy weather which we [en]dured at sea, rooted
out of the ground in <i>Terra Florida</i> right against that place
(which is 300 leagues over the sea), and brought thither.</p>

<p>So that we came to the said town of Vera Cruz; where we
remained a month. There the said <span class="smcap">John Field</span> chanced to
meet an old friend of his acquaintance in Spain, called
<span class="smcap">Gonzalo Ruiz de Cordova</span>, a very rich man of the said
town of Vera Cruz; who (hearing of his coming thither,
with his wife and family; and of his misfortune by sea) came
unto him, and received him and all his household into his
house, and kept us there a whole month, making us very
good cheer; and giving us good entertainment, and also gave
us, that were in all eight persons, of the said <span class="smcap">J. Field</span>'s
house, double apparel, new out of the shop, of very good
cloth, coats, cloaks, shirts, smocks, gowns for the women,
hose, shoes, and all other necessary apparel; and for our
way up to the city of Mexico, horses, moyles [<i>mules</i>], and
men; and money in our purses for the expenses by the way,
which by our account might amount unto the sum of 400
crowns [= &pound;120 <i>then = about</i> &pound;1,000 <i>now</i>].</p>

<p>After we were entered two days' journey into the country,
I, the said <span class="smcap">Robert Tomson</span>, fell sick of an ague: so that the
next day I was not able to sit on my horse; but was fain to
be carried upon Indians' backs from thence to Mexico.</p>

<p>And when we came within half a day's journey of the city
of Mexico, the said <span class="smcap">John Field</span> also fell sick; and within
three days after we arrived at the said city, he died. And
presently sickened one of his children, and two more of his
household people; who within eight days died. So that
within ten days after we arrived at the city of Mexico,
of eight persons that were of us of the said company, there
remained but four of us alive: and I, the said <span class="smcap">Tomson</span>, at
the point of death, of the sickness that I got on the way,
which continued with me for the space of six months [<i>till</i>
<i>October 1556</i>]. At the end of which time, it pleased GOD<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to restore me my health again, though weak and greatly
disabled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mexico was a city, in my time, of not above 1,500 households
of Spaniards inhabiting there; but of Indian people in
the suburbs of the said city, there dwelt about 300,000 as it was
thought, and many more. This city of Mexico is sixty-five
leagues from the North Sea [<i>the Gulf of Mexico</i>] and seventy-five
leagues from the South Sea [<i>the Pacific Ocean</i>]; so that it
standeth in the midst of the main land, betwixt the one sea
and the other.</p>

<p>It is situated in the midst of a lake of standing water, and
surrounded round about with the same; save, in many places,
going out of the city, are many broad ways through the said
lake or water. This lake and city are surrounded also with
great mountains round about, which are in compass above
thirty leagues; and the said city and lake of standing water
doth stand in a great plain in the midst of it. This lake of
standing water doth proceed from the shedding of the rain,
that falleth upon the said mountains; and so gathers itself
together in this place.</p>

<p>All the whole proportion of this city doth stand in a very
plain ground; and in the midst of the said city is a square
Place, of a good bow shot over from side to side. In the
midst of the said Place is a high Church, very fair and well
built all through, but at that time not half finished.</p>

<p>Round about the said Place, are many fair houses built.
On the one side are the houses where <span class="smcap">Montezuma</span>, the
great King of Mexico that was, dwelt; and now there lie
always the Viceroys that the King of Spain sendeth thither
every three years: and in my time there was for Viceroy a
gentleman of Castille, called <span class="smcap">Don Luis de Velasco</span>.</p>

<p>And on the other side of the said Place, over against the
same, is the Bishop's house, very fairly built; and many other
houses of goodly building. And hard by the same are also
other very fair houses, built by the Marquis <span class="smcap">de la Valle</span>,
otherwise called <span class="smcap">Hernando Cortes</span>; who was he that first
conquered the said city and country. After the said conquest
(which he made with great labour and travail of his
person, and danger of his life), being grown great in the
country; the King of Spain sent for him, saying that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
some particular matters to impart to him: and, when he
came home, he could not be suffered to return back again, as
the King before had promised him. With the sorrow for
which, he died: and this he had for the reward of his good
service.</p>

<p>The said city of Mexico hath streets made very broad and
right [<i>straight</i>] that a man being in the highway at one end
of the street, may see at the least a good mile forward: and
in all the one part of the streets of the north part of their
city, there runneth a pretty lake of very clear water, that
every man may put into his house as much as he will, without
the cost of anything but of the letting in.</p>

<p>Also there is a great ditch of water that cometh through
the city, even into the high Place; where come, every morning,
at break of the day, twenty or thirty canoes or troughs
of the Indians; which bring in them all manner of provisions
for the city that is made and groweth in the country: which
is a very good commodity for the inhabitants of that place.
And as for victuals in the said city, beef, mutton, hens, capons,
quails, guinea cocks, and such like, are all very good cheap;
as the whole quarter of an ox, as much as a slave can carry
away from the butcher's, for five tomynes, that is, five rials
of plate [<i>i.e., of silver. See Vol. III. p.</i> 184], which is just
2s. 6d. [= &pound;1 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d. now</i>]; and fat sheep at the butcher's, for
three rials, which is 1s. 6d. [= 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d. now</i>], and no more.
Bread is as good cheap as in Spain; and all other kinds
of fruits, as apples, pears, pomegranates, and quinces, at a
reasonable rate.</p>

<p>The city goeth wonderfully forward in building of Friaries
and Nunneries, and Chapels; and is like, in time to come, to
be the most populous city in the world, as it may be supposed.</p>

<p>The weather is there always very temperate. The day differeth
but one hour of length all the year long. The fields and
woods are always green. The woods are full of popinjays,
and many other kind of birds, that make such a harmony of
singing and crying, that any man will rejoice to hear it. In
the fields are such odoriferous smells of flowers and herbs,
that it giveth great content to the senses.</p>

<p>In my time, were dwelling and alive in Mexico, many
ancient men that were of the Conquerors, at the first con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>quest
with <span class="smcap">Hernando Cortes</span>: for, then, it was about
thirty-six years ago, that the said country was conquered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being something strong, I procured to seek means to live,
and to seek a way how to profit myself in the country seeing
it had pleased GOD to send us thither in safety.</p>

<p>Then, by the friendship of one <span class="smcap">Thomas Blake</span>, a Scottish-man
born, who had dwelt, and had been married in the said
city above twenty years before I came to the said city [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>before 1536</i>], I was preferred to the service of a gentleman, a
Spaniard dwelling there, a man of great wealth, and of one of
the first conquerors of the said city, whose name was <span class="smcap">Gonzalo</span>
<span class="smcap">Serezo</span>: with whom I dwelt twelve months and a half [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>up to November 1557</i>]; at the end of which, I was maliciously
accused by the Holy House for matters of religion.</p>

<p>And because it shall be known wherefore it was, that I
was so punished by the clergy's hand; I will in brief words,
declare the same.</p>

<p>It is so, that, being in Mexico, at table, among many
principal people at dinner, they began to inquire of me, being
an Englishman, "Whether it were true that in England,
they had overthrown all their Churches and Houses of Religion;
and that all the images of the saints of heaven that
were in them, were thrown down and broken, and burned,
and [that they] in some places stoned highways with them;
and [that they] denied their obedience to the Pope of Rome:
as they had been certified out of Spain by their friends?"</p>

<p>To whom, I made answer, "That it was so. That, in
deed, they had in England, put down all the religious houses
of friars and monks that were in England; and the images
that were in their churches and other places were taken
away, and used there no more. For that, as they say, the
making of them, and the putting of them where they were
adored, was clean contrary to the express commandment of
Almighty GOD, <i>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven</i>
<i>image &amp;c.</i>: and that, for that cause, they thought it not
lawful that they should stand in the church, which is, the
House of Adoration."</p>

<p>One that was at the declaring of these words, who was my
master, <span class="smcap">Gonzalo Serezo</span>, answered and said, "If it were
against the commandment of GOD, to have images in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
churches; that then he had spent a great deal of money in
vain; for that, two years past [<i>i.e., in 1555</i>] he had made in
the Monastery of Santo Domingo in the said city of Mexico,
an image of Our Lady, of pure silver and gold, with pearls
and precious stones, which cost him 7,000 and odd <i>pesos</i>"
(and every <i>peso</i> is 6s. 8d. of our money) [= <i>about</i> &pound;2,400, or
<i>about</i> &pound;24,000 <i>now</i>]: which indeed was true, for I have seen
it many times myself where it stands.</p>

<p>At the table was another gentleman, who, presuming to
defend the cause more than any one that was there, said,
"That they knew well enough, that they were made but of
stocks and stones, and that to them was no worship given;
but that there was a certain veneration due unto them after
they were set up in church: and that they were set there with
a good intent. The one, for that they were Books for the
Simple People, to make them understand the glory of the
saints that were in heaven, and a shape of them; to put us
in remembrance to call upon them to be our intercessors unto
GOD for us: for that we are such miserable sinners that we
are not worthy to appear before GOD; and that using devotion
to saints in heaven, they may obtain at GOD's hands,
the sooner, the thing that we demand of Him. As, for
example," he said, "imagine that a subject hath offended his
King upon the earth in any kind of respect; is it for the
party to go boldly to the King in person, and to demand
pardon for his offences? No," saith he, "the presumption
were too great; and possibly he might be repulsed, and have
a great rebuke for his labour. Better it is for such a person
to seek some private man near the King in his Court, and to
make him acquainted with this matter, and let him be a
mediator to His Majesty for him and for the matter he had to
do with him; and so might he the better come to his purpose,
and obtain the thing which he doth demand. Even so,"
saith he, "it is with GOD and His saints in heaven. For
we are wretched sinners; and not worthy to appear or
present ourselves before the Majesty of GOD, to demand of
Him the thing that we have need of: therefore thou hast
need to be devout! and have devotion to the mother of God,
and the saints in heaven, to be intercessors to GOD for thee!
and so mayest thou the better obtain of GOD, the thing that
thou dost demand!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>To this I answered, "Sir, as touching the comparison you
made of the intercessors to the King, how necessary they were,
I would but ask of you this question. Set the case, that this
King you speak of, if he be so merciful as when he knoweth
that one or any of his subjects hath offended him; he send
for him to his own town, or to his own house or place, and
say unto him, 'Come hither! I know that thou hast offended
many laws! if thou dost know thereof, and dost repent thee
of the same, with full intent to offend no more, I will forgive
thee thy trespass, and remember it no more!'" Said I, "If
this be done by the King's own person, what then hath this
man need go and seek friendship at any of the King's private
servants' hands; but go to the principal: seeing that he is
readier to forgive thee, than thou art to demand forgiveness
at his hands!"</p>

<p>"Even so is it, with our gracious GOD, who calleth and
crieth out unto us throughout all the world, by the mouth of
His prophets and apostles; and, by His own mouth, saith,
'Come unto me all ye that labour and are over laden, and I
will refresh you!' besides a thousand other offers and
proffers, which He doth make unto us in His Holy Scriptures.
What then have we need of the saints' help that are in
heaven, whereas the LORD Himself doth so freely offer
Himself for us?"</p>

<p>At which sayings, many of the hearers were astonied, and
said that, "By that reason, I would give to understand
that the Invocation of Saints was to be disannulled, and by
the laws of GOD not commanded."</p>

<p>I answered, "That they were not my words, but the words
of GOD Himself. Look into the Scriptures yourself, and you
shall so find it!"</p>

<p>The talk was perceived to be prejudicial to the Romish
doctrine; and therefore it was commanded to be no more
entreated of. And all remained unthought upon, had it not
been for a villainous Portuguese that was in the company,
who said, <i>Basta ser Ingles para saber todo esto y mas</i>, who, the
next day, without imparting anything to anybody, went to the
Bishop of <span class="smcap">Mexico</span> and his Provisor, and said, that "In a
place where he had been the day before was an Englishman,
who had said that <i>there was no need of Saints in the Church, nor</i>
<i>of any Invocation of Saints</i>." Upon whose denomination [<i>de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>nouncement</i>],
I was apprehended for the same words here rehearsed,
and none other thing; and thereupon was used as
hereafter is written.</p>

<p>So, apprehended, I was carried to prison, where I lay a
close prisoner seven months [<i>till July 1558</i>], without speaking
to any creature, but to the gaoler that kept the said prison,
when he brought me my meat and drink. In the meantime,
was brought into the said prison, one <span class="smcap">Augustine Boacio</span>, an
Italian of Genoa, also for matters of religion; who was taken
at Zacatecas, eighty leagues to the north-westward of the city
of Mexico.</p>

<p>At the end of the said seven months [<i>i.e., in July 1558</i>], we
were both carried to the high Church of Mexico, to do an
open penance upon a high scaffold made before the high altar,
upon a Sunday, in the presence of a very great number of
people; who were, at least, 5,000 or 6,000. For there were
some that came one hundred miles off to see the said <i>auto</i>,
as they call it; for that there was never any before, that had
done the like in the said country: nor could tell what
Lutherans were, nor what it meant; for they never heard of
any such thing before.</p>

<p>We were brought into the Church, every one with a <i>san benito</i>
upon his back; which is, half a yard of yellow cloth, with a
hole to put in a man's head in the midst, and cast over a
man's head: both flaps hang, one before, and another behind;
and in the midst of every flap a Saint Andrew's cross, made
of red cloth, and sewed in upon the same. And that is called
<i>San Benito</i>.</p>

<p>The common people, before they saw the penitents come
into the Church, were given to understand that we were
heretics, infidels, and people that did despise GOD and His
works, and that we had been more like devils than men; and
thought we had had the favour [<i>appearance</i>] of some monsters
or heathen people: and when they saw us come into the
Church in our players' coats, the women and children began
to cry out and made such a noise, that it was strange to
hear and see; saying, that "They never saw goodlier men
in all their lives; and that it was not possible that there
could be in us so much evil as was reported of us; and
that we were more like angels among men, than such
persons of such evil religion as by the priests and friars, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
were reported to be; and that it was a great pity that we
should be so used for so small an offence."</p>

<p>So that we were brought into the said high Church, and set
upon the scaffold which was made before the high altar, in
the presence of all the people, until <i>High Mass</i> was done; and
the Sermon made by a friar concerning our matter: putting
us in all the disgrace they could, to cause the people not
to take so much compassion upon us, for that "we were
heretics, and people seduced of the Devil, and had forsaken
the faith of the Catholic Church of Rome"; with divers other
reproachful words, which were too long to recite in this place.</p>

<p><i>High Mass</i> and Sermon being done; our offences (as they
called them) were recited, each man what he had said and
done: and presently was the sentence pronounced against us,
that was that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The said <span class="smcap">Augustine Boacio</span> was condemned to wear
his <i>San Benito</i> all the days of his life, and put into perpetual
prison, where he should fulfil the same; and all
his goods confiscated and lost.</p>

<p>And I, the said <span class="smcap">Tomson</span>, to wear the <i>San Benito</i> for
three years; and then to be set at liberty.</p>

<p>And for the accomplishing of this sentence or condemnation,
we must be presently sent down from Mexico to
Vera Cruz, and from thence to San Juan de Ulua, which
was sixty-five leagues by land; and there to be shipped
for Spain, with straight commandment that, upon pain
of 1,000 ducats, every one of the Masters should look
straightly unto us, and carry us to Spain, and deliver us
unto the Inquisitors of the Holy House of Seville; that
they should put us in the places, where we should fulfil
our penances that the Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Mexico</span> had enjoined
unto us, by his sentence there given.</p></div>

<p>For the performance of the which, we were sent down
from Mexico to the seaside, with fetters upon our feet; and
there delivered to the Masters of the ships to be carried for
Spain, as is before said.</p>

<p>And it was so, that the Italian fearing that if he presented
himself in Spain before the Inquisitors, that they would have
burnt him; to prevent that danger, when we were coming
homeward, and were arrived at the island of Terceira, one of
the isles of Azores, the first night that we came to an anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
in the said port [<i>i.e., of Angra</i>], about midnight, he found
the means to get him naked out of the ship into the sea, and
swam naked ashore; and so presently got him to the further
side of the island, where he found a little caravel ready to
depart for Portugal. In the which he came to Lisbon; and
passed into France, and so into England; where he ended his
life in the city of London.</p>

<p>And I, for my part, kept still aboard the ship, and came
into Spain; and was delivered to the Inquisitors of the Holy
House of Seville, where they kept me in close prison till I
had fulfilled the three years of my penance, [<i>i.e., till about</i>
<i>1561</i>].</p>

<p>Which time being expired, I was freely put out of prison,
and set at liberty.</p>

<p>Being in the city of Seville, a cashier of one <span class="smcap">Hugh Typton</span>,
an English merchant of great doing, by the space of one year
[<i>i.e., till about 1562</i>]; it fortuned that there came out of the
city of Mexico, a Spaniard, <span class="smcap">Juan de la Barrera</span>, that had
been long time in the Indies, and had got great sums of gold
and silver. He, with one only daughter, shipped himself for
to come to Spain; and, by the way, chanced to die, and gave
all that he had unto his only daughter, whose name was
<span class="smcap">Maria de la Barrera</span>.</p>

<p>She having arrived at the city of Seville, it was my chance
to marry with her. The marriage was worth to me &pound;2,500
[= &pound;25,000 <i>now</i>] in bars of gold and silver, besides jewels of
great price. This I thought good to speak of, to show the
goodness of GOD to all them that trust in Him; that I, being
brought out of the Indies in such great misery and infamy
to the world, should be provided at GOD's hand, in one moment,
of more than in all my life before, I could attain unto
by my own labour.</p>

<p>After we departed from Mexico, our <i>San Benitos</i> were set
up in the high Church of the said city, with our names written
in the same, according to their use and custom; which is and
will be a monument and a remembrance of us, as long as the
Romish Church doth reign in that country. The same have
been seen since, by one <span class="smcap">John Chilton</span>; and divers others of
our nation, which were left in that country, long since [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>in October 1568</i>] by Sir <span class="smcap">John Hawkins</span>.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">How</span> hard an enterprise it is, in this skilful and
curious Age, to commit our private labours to the
public view, mine own disability and others' hard
success do too well assure me: and were it not
for that love [which] I bear to the true lovers of music,
I had concealed these my first fruits; which how they will
thrive with your taste I know not, howsoever the greater
part of them might have been ripe enough by their age. The
Courtly judgement, I hope will not be severe against them,
being itself a party; and those sweet Springs of Humanity, I
mean our two famous Universities, will entertain them for
his sake whom they have already graced, and, as it were, enfranchised
in the ingenuous profession of Music: which, from
my childhood I have ever aimed at, sundry times leaving my
native country, the better to attain so excellent a science.</p>

<p>About sixteen years past [<i>i.e., in 1580</i>], I travelled the
chiefest parts of France, a nation furnished with great variety
of Music; but lately, being of a more confirmed judgement, I
bent my course towards the famous provinces of Germany,
where I found both excellent Masters, and most honourable
patrons of music, namely, those two miracles of this Age for
virtue and magnificence, <span class="smcap">Henry Julio</span>, Duke of Brunswick,
and the learned <span class="smcap">Maurice</span>, Landgrave of Hesse; of whose
princely virtues and favours towards me, I can never speak
sufficiently. Neither can I forget the kindness of <span class="smcap">Alexandro</span>
<span class="smcap">Horologio</span>, a right learned master of music, servant to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
royal Prince, the Landgrave of Hesse, and <span class="smcap">Gregorio Howet</span>,
Lutenist to the magnificent Duke of Brunswick; both [of]
whom I name, as well for their love to me as also for their
excellency in their faculties.</p>

<p>Thus having spent some months in Germany, to my great
admiration of that worthy country; I passed over the Alps
into Italy, where I found the Cities furnished with all good
arts, but especially music. What favour and estimation I
had in Venice, Padua, Genoa, Ferrara, Florence, and divers
other places, I willingly suppress; lest I should, [in] any way,
seem partial in mine own endeavours. Yet I cannot dissemble
the great content I found in the proffered amity of
the most famous <span class="smcap">Luca Marenzio</span>, whose sundry letters I
received from Rome; and one of them, because it is but
short, I have thought good to set down, not thinking it any
disgrace to be proud of the judgement of so excellent a man.</p>

<i>offerendomegli all'incontro se in alcuna cosa la posso servire, poi</i>

<i>The state of a Christian lively set forth,</i>
<i>by an allegory of a Ship under Sail.</i></h2>

<p class="center">[This Writer was evidently a forerunner of <span class="smcap">John Bunyan</span>.]</p>

<p class="center">Prov. xxxi. 14. Job ix. 26. Isaiah xxiii. 1. Rev. viii. 9.</p>

<i>The Victory of Patience</i>. 1636.]</p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/049m.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">My</span> body is the Hull, the Keel my back, my neck
the Stem; the Sides are my ribs, the Beams my
bones, my flesh the Planks; gristles and ligaments
are the Pintels and Knee-timbers; arteries, veins,
and sinews, the several Seams of the ship; my
blood is the Ballast, my heart the Principal Hold, my stomach
the Cook-room, my liver the Cistern, my bowels the Sink;
my lungs the Bellows, my teeth the Chopping-knives; except
you divide them, and then they are the 32 Points of the Compass,
both agreeing in number. Concoction is the Cauldron,
and hunger the Salt or Sauce. My belly is the Lower Deck,
my kidneys Close Cabins or receptacles, my thighs are Long
Galleries for the grace of the ship; my arms and hands the
Canhooks, my midriff is a large partition or Bulkhead. Within
the circumference of my head is placed the Steeridge Room
and Chief Cabins, with the Round-house [<i>now called the</i>
<i>Captain's Cabin</i>] where the Master lieth: and these for the
more safety and decency are enclosed in a double fence; the
one <i>Dura mater</i>, something hard and thick [<i>the skull</i>], the
other <i>Pia mater</i>, very thin and soft [<i>the hair</i>], which serveth
instead of hangings. The ears are two doors or Scuttles
fitly placed for entertainment; the two eyes are Casements to
let in light; under them, is my mouth, the Stowage or
Steward's Room. My lips are Hatches for receipt of goods,
my two nostrils serve as Gratings to let in air. At the one
end stands my chin, which is the Beakhead. My forehead is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the Upper Deck; all which being trimmed with my fat instead
of Pitch, and hair instead of Oakum, are coloured with my skin.</p>

<p>The Fore Deck is humility, the Stern, charity. Active
obedience, the Sails; which being hoisted up with the several
Yards, Halliards, and Bowlines of holy precepts and good
purposes; are let down again by fickleness, faintings and inconstancy.
Reason is my Rudder, experience the Helm, hope
of salvation my Anchor, passive obedience the Capstan, holy
revenge the Cat and Fish to haul the Sheet Anchor or last
hope. Fear of offending is the Buoy, virtues are the Cables,
holy desires and sudden ejaculations the Shrouds. The zeal
of GOD's glory is my Mainmast, premeditation the Foremast,
desire of my own salvation the Mizenmast, saving knowledge
the Bowsprit, circumspection a Sounding line.</p>

<p>My Light is illumination; justice is the Card [<i>Map</i>]; GOD's
Word, the Compass; the meditation of life's brevity, a Four-Hour
Glass [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>the length of a ship's watch</i>]; contemplation of
the creatures, the Cross-staff or Jacob's-staff; the creed, a
Sea-Grammar; the life of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, my Load-Star. The saint's
falls are Sea-marks; good examples, Land-marks. Repentance
pumps out the sink of my sins, a good conscience keeps me
clean. Imputative righteousness is my Flag, having this
motto, <i>Being cast down, we perish not!</i> the Flag-staff is
sincerity.</p>

<p>The ship is victualled afresh by reading, hearing, receiving.
Books are Long-boats, letters are little Skiffs to carry and
recarry my spiritual merchandise. Perseverance is my Speed,
and patience my Name. My Fire is lust, which will not be
clean extinguished: full feeding and strong drink are the Fuel
to maintain it; whose Flame, if it be not suppressed, is jealousy;
whose Sparks are evil words, whose Ashes are envy; whose
Smoke is infamy. Lascivious talk is a Flint and Steel, concupiscence
as Tinder, opportunity the Match to light it, sloth
and idleness are the Servants to prepare it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Law of GOD</span> is my Pilot, <span class="smcap">Faith</span> my Captain, <span class="smcap">Fortitude</span>
the Master, <span class="smcap">Chastity</span> the Master's Mate, my <span class="smcap">Will</span> the Coxswain,
<span class="smcap">Conscience</span> the Preacher [<i>or, as we now say, Chaplain</i>],
<span class="smcap">Application of Christ's death</span> the Surgeon, <span class="smcap">Mortification</span>
the Cook, <span class="smcap">Vivification</span> the Caulker, <span class="smcap">Self-denial</span> an Apprentice
of his, <span class="smcap">Temperance</span> the Steward, <span class="smcap">Contentation</span> his
Mate, <span class="smcap">Truth</span> the Purser, <span class="smcap">Thankfulness</span> the Purser's Mate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Reformation</span> the Boatswain, the Four <span class="smcap">Humours, Sanguine,</span>
<span class="smcap">Choler</span>, &amp;c., are the Quarter-masters; <span class="smcap">Christian Vigilancy</span>
undertakes to supply the office of the Starboard and Larboard
Watches, <span class="smcap">Memory</span> is the Clerk of the Cheque, <span class="smcap">Assurance</span>
the Corporal, the Armour <span class="smcap">Innocency</span>, the Mariners, <span class="smcap">Angels</span>.</p>

<p>Schismatics are Searchers sent abroad. My <span class="smcap">Understanding</span>,
as Master Gunner, culls out from those two Budge-casks
of the <i>Old</i> and <i>New Testaments</i> certain threats and promises
which are my only Powder and Shot; and with the assistance
of the Gunner's Mate, <span class="smcap">Holy Anger against Sin</span>, chargeth my
tongue, which, like to a piece of ordnance, shoots them to
the shame and overthrow of my spiritual Adversaries.</p>

<p>My noble passengers are <span class="smcap">Joy in the Holy Ghost</span> and
<span class="smcap">Peace of Conscience</span>, whose retinue are <span class="smcap">Divine Graces</span>.
My ignoble or rather mutinous passengers are <span class="smcap">Worldly</span>
<span class="smcap">Cogitations</span> and <span class="smcap">Vain Delights</span> which are more than a
good many; besides some that are arrant thieves and traitors,
namely, <span class="smcap">Pride, Envy, Prejudice</span>: but all these I will bid
farewell to, when I come to my journey's end; though I
would, but cannot, before.</p>

<p>Heaven is my Country, where I am Registered in the Book
of Life, my King is JEHOVAH. My Tribute alms-deeds: they
which gather it are the poor. Love is my country's Badge,
my Language is holy conference, my Fellow Companions are
the saints.</p>

<p>I am poor in performances, yet rich in GOD's acceptation.
The Foundation of all my good is GOD's free election. I became
Bound into the Corporation of the Church to serve Him,
in my baptism. I was Enrolled at the time when He first called
me. My Freedom is justification. It was Purchased with the
blood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. My Evidence is the earnest of His spirit.
My Privileges are His sanctifying graces. My Crown,
reserved for me on high, is glorification.</p>

<p>My Maker and Owner is GOD; who built me by His
Word, which is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; of earth, which was the Material;
He freighted it with the essence of my Soul, which is the
Treasure; and hath set me to sail in the Sea of this world,
till I attain to the Port of death: which letteth the terrestrial
part into the Harbour of the grave, and the celestial part into
the Kingdom of Heaven. In which voyage, conveniency of
estate [<i>comfortable circumstances</i>] is as sea room; good affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
serve as a tide; and prayer as a prosperous gale, a wind to
help forward.</p>

<p>But innumerable are the impediments and perils. For
here I meet with the profers of unlawful gain and sensual
delights, as so many <span class="smcap">Sirens</span>; the baits of prosperity, as High
Banks, on the right hand or Weather Shore; and there with
evil suggestions and crabbed adversity, as Rocks, on the left
hand or Lee Shore, ready to split me. The fear of hell, like
Quicksands, threatens to swallow me; original sin like Weeds
clog me, and actual transgressions like so many Barnacles
hang about me. Yea, every sin I commit springs a new Leak.
My senses are as so many Storms of Rain, Hail, and Snow to
sink me. Lewd affections are Roaring Billows and Waves.
Self-confidence, or to rely upon anything but the Divine
assistance, is to lose the Bowsprit. Restitution is heaving
goods overboard to save the ship. Melancholy is want of
Fresh Water. The scoffs of atheists, and contempt of
religion in all places is a notable becalming; the lewd lives and
evil examples of them most a contagious air. Idleness furrs
it, and is a shrewd decay, both of the Hull and Tackling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Moreover, sailing along, and keeping Watch (for they that
be <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s friends, you know! must look for all they meet
to be their enemies), we no sooner look up, but presently we
ken a Man of War, and then we must be for war too, and
provide for a skirmish.</p>

<p>Now the Galleon that hath our Pinnace in chase, and always
watcheth for advantages to surprise it, is the Piracy of Hell;
the Synagogue of <span class="smcap">Satan</span>. Her Freight is temptations and
persecutions, with all the engines of mischief. In which the
<span class="smcap">Devil</span> is Master, <span class="smcap">Malice</span> the Master's Mate, <span class="smcap">Cruelty</span> the
Captain, <span class="smcap">Murder</span> the Cook, <span class="smcap">Flattery</span> the Caulker,
<span class="smcap">Profaneness</span> a Quartermaster, <span class="smcap">Riot</span> the Steward, <span class="smcap">Never</span>
<span class="smcap">Content</span> his Mate, <span class="smcap">Pride</span> the Coxswain, <span class="smcap">Superstition</span> the
Preacher, <span class="smcap">Hypocrisy</span> the Boatswain, <span class="smcap">Covetousness</span> the
Purser, <span class="smcap">Lust</span> the Swabber, <span class="smcap">Fury</span> the Gunner, <span class="smcap">Presumption</span>
the Corporal, <span class="smcap">Sedition</span> the Trumpeter, <span class="smcap">Drunkenness</span> the
Drummer.</p>

<p>Vices are the Sails, custom the Mainmast, example of the
multitude the Foremast, lusts and passions the Cables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
blindness of mind the Rudder, hardness of heart the Helm,
the wisdom of the flesh the Card, the mystery of iniquity the
Compass. The five senses, or if you will, scoffing Atheists,
profane foul-mouthed drunkards, and all the rabble of hell
are the Mariners. Lewd affections the Passengers, <span class="smcap">Little</span>
<span class="smcap">Conscience</span> the Load star.</p>

<p>She hath two tire of great ordnance planted in her,
Heresy and Irreligion; being either for a false god, or none.
Oaths, blasphemy, and curses are the Powder and Shot:
which they spit against all that worship the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, or fight
under the Ensign of Faith. Her Armour is carnal security.
The Flag in her Top is infidelity: the motto, <i>There is no</i>
<i>god, but gain!</i></p>

<p>Her Ballast, which keeps her upright, is Ignorance. Most
of her Tackling she has from Rome, or Amsterdam. <span class="smcap">Antichrist</span>,
as Pilot, steers her in such a course that she goes on
swiftly, proudly, securely, scorning and scoffing (<span class="smcap">Sennacherib</span>
like) to hear that any Lord should deliver this poor
Pinnace out of her hands.</p>

<p>Yet in the sequel, this silly Pink, having the Insurance of
GOD's omnipresence, finds not only succour from the Stock
of the Church's prayers, which, like another Merchantman,
come in to the rescue: but, likewise that GOD's Almighty
power and providence is near at hand, as a strong Castle of
Defence to free her, whereby she escapes, even as a bird out
of the snare of the hunter, to praise the LORD: who hath
not given her as a prey unto their teeth, that would have
swallowed up all quick; but delivered her from such swelling
waters, floods of affliction and streams of persecution, as
else had gone over her and even drowned her soul, as it is
<i>Psalm</i> cxxiv. While this great Galleon (though it seems like
that Invincible Armada) flies; and, having no Anchor, when the
storms of GOD's wrath arise, down she sinks to desperation;
and perisheth in the bottomless pit or burning lake of fire
and brimstone: where we will leave her to receive a just
recompense of reward.</p>

<span class="smcap">Underhill</span> (son and heir of <span class="smcap">Thomas Underhill</span> of
Honingham, in the county of Warwick, Esquire) being
of the Band of the Pensioners [<i>see pp. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>-<a href="#Page_94">94</a></i>], for a ballet

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/072t.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day [4th] after the Queen was come to
the Tower [<i>on the 3rd of August, 1553</i>]; the foresaid
ballet [<i>ballad</i>] came into the hands of Secretary
[Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>; who straightways made
inquiry for me, the said <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, who dwelt at
Limehurst [<i>Limehouse</i>]; which he having intelligence of, sent
the Sheriff of Middlesex, with a company of bills and glaives
[<i>lances, with a cutting blade at the end of each</i>]; who came unto
my house, I being in my bed, and my wife being newly laid
in childbed.</p>

<p>The High Constable, whose name was <span class="smcap">Thomas Ive</span>, dwelt
at the next house unto me, the said <span class="smcap">Edward</span>; whom the
Sheriff brought also with him. He, being my very friend,
desired the Sheriff and his company to stay without, for [fear
of af]frighting of my wife, being newly laid; and he would go
and fetch me unto him. Who knocked at the door, saying,
"He must speak with me."</p>

<p>I, lying so near that I might hear him, called unto him,
willing him "to come unto me!" for that he was always my
very friend, and earnest in the Gospel. Who declared unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
me that the Sheriff, with a great company with him, was
sent for me.</p>

<p>Whereupon I rose, made me ready, and came unto him,
demanding, "What he would with me?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "I have commandment from the Council
to apprehend you, and forthwith to bring you unto them."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "it is now ten o'clock in the night; ye
cannot, now, carry me unto them!"</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said he, "you shall go with me to my house to
London, where you shall have a bed: and to-morrow, I will
bring you unto them at the Tower."</p>

<p>"In the name of GOD! [=<i>most certainly</i>]," said I: and so
went with him, requiring [<i>inquiring of</i>] him, "If I might
understand the cause."</p>

<p>He said, "He knew none."</p>

<p>"This needed not, then," said I; "any one messenger
might have fetched me unto them": suspecting the cause
to be, as it was indeed, the ballet.</p>

<p>On the morrow [<i>5th of August, 1553</i>], the Sheriff, seeing me
nothing dismayed, thinking it to be some light matter, went
not with me himself: but sent me unto the Tower with two of
his men, waiting upon me with two bills [<i>men with halberts</i>],
prisoner-like, who brought me unto the Council Chamber;
being commanded to deliver me unto Secretary <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>.</p>

<p>Thus standing waiting at the Council Chamber door, two
or three of my fellows, the Pensioners, and my cousin-german
<span class="smcap">Gilbert Wynter</span>, Gentleman Usher unto the Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
[<i>see p.</i> 120], stood talking with me.</p>

<p>In the meantime, cometh Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Hastings</span> [<i>see</i>
<i>Vol. III. p. 147</i>], newly made Master of the Horse to the
Queen, and seeing me standing there prisoner, frowning earnestly
upon me, said, "Are you come? We will talk with you
or your party, I warrant you!" and so went into the Council.</p>

<p>With that, my fellows and kinsman shrank away from me,
as men greatly afraid.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I did then perceive the said Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span> bare in remembrance
the controversy that was betwixt him and
me in talk and questions of religion at Calais, when the
Right Honourable the Earl of <span class="smcap">Huntingdon</span>, his brother,
went over, General of 6,000 men: with whom I went the
same time, and was Controller of the Ordnance.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<p>The Earl being visited with sickness when he came
thither, for that I went over in his company, and could
play and sing to the lute, therewith to pass away
the time, on the nights being long, for we went over
in Christmas [1552], would have me with him in his
chamber; and had also a great delight to hear his brother
reason with me in matters of religion. Who would be
very hot, when I did overlay him with the texts of the
Scripture concerning the natural presence of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in
the sacrament of the altar; and would swear great oaths,
specially, "by the Lord's foot!" that after the words
spoken by the priest there remained no bread, but the
natural body that <span class="smcap">Mary</span> bare.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, it must needs be so," would I say, "and
[<i>if</i>] you prove it with such oaths!"</p>

<p>Whereat the Earl would laugh heartily, saying,
"Brother, give him over! <span class="smcap">Underhill</span> is too good for
you!" Wherewith he would be very angry.</p>

<p>The greatest hold that he took of, was of the 3rd of
<i><span class="smcap">John</span></i>, upon those words, "And no man ascendeth up to
heaven, but He that came down from heaven, that is to
say, the Son of Man which is in heaven." I drove him
from the 6th of <i><span class="smcap">John</span></i> and all other places that he could
allege; but from this, he would not be removed, but
that those words proved his natural body to be in heaven
and in the sacrament also. I told him he as grossly
understood <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, as <span class="smcap">Nicodemus</span> did in the same place,
of "being born anew."</p>

<p>In my opinion, any man that is not given up of GOD,
may be satisfied concerning the natural presence in the
Supper of the Lord, by the Gospel of Saint <span class="smcap">John</span>, reading
from the first chapter to the end of the seventeenth; with
the witness of the first of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s ascension and coming again; if ever he will be
satisfied, without the help of any Doctors.</p></div>

<p>Undoubtedly, the apprehending of me was for this matter:
but the great mercy of GOD so provided for me, that Master
<span class="smcap">Hastings</span> was not at my examination. For tarrying thus at
the Chamber door, Doctor Cox [<i>afterwards Bishop of <span class="smcap">Ely</span></i>]
was within; who came forth, and was sent to the Marshalsea.
Then came forth the Lord <span class="smcap">Ferrers</span>, [Viscount <span class="smcap">Hereford</span>],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and was committed to the Tower. Then it was dinner time,
and all were commanded to depart until after dinner.</p>

<p>My two waiting men and I went to an alehouse to dinner;
and, longing to know my pain [<i>punishment</i>], I made haste to
get to the Council Chamber door, that I might be the first.</p>

<p>Immediately, as they had dined, Secretary <span class="smcap">Bourne</span> came
to the door, looking as a wolf doth for a lamb; unto whom
my two keepers delivered me, standing next unto the door:
for there were more behind me.</p>

<p>He took me in greedily, and shut to the door; leaving
me at the nether [<i>lower</i>] end of the Chamber, he went unto
the Council showing them of me: and then beckoned me to
come near.</p>

<p>Then they began the table, and sat them down. The Earl
of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> sat as chief, uppermost upon the bench. Next
unto him, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>; next him, Sir <span class="smcap">Richard</span>
<span class="smcap">Southwell</span>.</p>

<p>On the side next me, sat the Earl of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>; next him,
the Lord <span class="smcap">Paget</span>. By them, stood Sir <span class="smcap">John Gage</span>, then
Constable of the Tower; the Earl of <span class="smcap">Bath</span>, and Master
[<i>afterwards Sir <span class="smcap">John</span></i>] <span class="smcap">Mason</span>.</p>

<p>At the board's end, stood Serjeant <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> [<i>who, later on,</i>
<i>condemned Lady <span class="smcap">Jane Grey</span></i>] that afterwards died mad; and
Secretary [Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>.</p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Wentworth</span> [<i>the Lord Deputy of Calais, when</i>
<i>lost; see p.</i> 173] stood in the bay window, talking with one,
all the while of my examination, whom I knew not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Lord of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> being my very friend, (for that my
chance was to be at the recovering of his son, my Lord
<span class="smcap">Russell</span>, when he was cast into the Thames against the
Limehurst, whom I carried to my house and got him to
bed; who was in great peril of his life, the weather being
very cold) would not seem to be familiar with me, nor
called me not by my name, but said, "Come hither,
sirrah! did not you set forth a ballet of late, in print?"</p></div>

<p>I kneeled down, saying, "Yes, truly, my Lord! Is that
the cause I am called before your Honours?"</p>

<p>"Ay, marry," said Secretary <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>, "you have one of
them about you, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Nay, truly, have I not," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he took one out of his bosom, and read it over distinctly;
the Council giving diligent ear.</p>

<p>When he had ended, "I trust, my Lords," said I, "I have
not offended the Queen's Majesty in this ballet; nor spoken
against her title, but maintained it."</p>

<p>"You have, sir," said Morgan, "yes, I can divide your
ballet, and make a distinction in it; and so prove at the least
sedition in it."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," said I, "you men of law will make of a matter
what ye list!"</p>

<p>"Lo," said Sir <span class="smcap">Richard Southwell</span>, "how he can give
a taunt! You maintain the Queen's title, with the help of
an arrant heretic, <span class="smcap">Tyndale</span>."</p>

<p>"You speak of Papists there, sir," said Master <span class="smcap">Mason</span>, "I
pray you, how define you a Papist?"</p>

<p>I look upon him, turning towards him; for he stood on the
side of me, "Why, sir," said I, "it is not long since you
could define a Papist better than I" [<i>meaning that he had</i>
<i>turned with the new change of religion</i>]. With that some
of them secretly smiled; as the Lords of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>, <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, and <span class="smcap">Paget</span>.</p>

<p>In great haste, Sir <span class="smcap">John Gage</span> took the matter in hand,
"Thou callest men Papists there," said he, "who be they
that thou judgest to be Papists?"</p>

<p>I said, "Sir, I do name no man, and I came not hither to
accuse any, nor none will I accuse; but your Honours do
know that in this Controversy that hath been, some be called
Papists, and some Protestants."</p>

<p>"But we must know whom thou judgest to be Papists, and
that we command thee, upon thine allegiance to declare!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I think if you look among the priests in
Paul's, ye shall find some old <i>Mumpsimuses</i> there."</p>

<p>"<i>Mumpsimuses</i>, knave!" said he, "<i>Mumpsimuses!</i> Thou
art an heretic knave, by God's blood!"</p>

<p>"Ay, by the mass!" says the Earl of <span class="smcap">Bath</span>, "I warrant
him an heretic knave indeed."</p>

<p>"I beseech your Honours!" said I, speaking to the Lords
that sat at table; for those other stood by, and were not
then of the Council, "be my good Lords! I have offended no
laws, and I have served the Queen's Majesty's father and
brother a long time; and in their service have spent and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>sumed
part of my living, never having, as yet, any preferment
or recompense; and the rest of my fellows likewise, to our
utter undoings, unless the Queen's Highness be good unto
us. And for my part, I went not forth against Her Majesty;
notwithstanding that I was commanded, nor liked those
doings."</p>

<p>"No, but with your writings, you would set us together by
the ears!" said the Earl of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>.</p>

<p>"He hath spent his living wantonly," saith <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>, "and
now saith he has spent it in the King's service; which I am
sorry for. He is come of a worshipful house in Worcestershire."</p>

<p>"It is untruly said of you," said I, "that I have spent my
living wantonly: for I never consumed any part thereof until
I came into the King's service; which I do not repent, nor
doubted of recompense, if either of my two masters had lived.
I perceive you [to be] <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>'s son of Worcester; who was
beholden unto my uncle <span class="smcap">Wynter</span>, and therefore you have no
cause to be my enemy: nor you never knew me, nor I you
before now, which is too soon."</p>

<p>"I have heard enough of you," said he.</p>

<p>"So have I of you," said I, "how that Master <span class="smcap">Sheldon</span>
drave you out of Worcestershire, for your behaviour."</p>

<p>With that, came Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Hastings</span> from the Queen,
in great haste, saying, "My Lords! you must set all things
apart, and come forthwith to the Queen."</p>

<p>Then said the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, "Have this gentleman unto
the Fleet until we may talk further with him!" though I
was "knave," before, of Master <span class="smcap">Gage</span>.</p>

<p>"To the Fleet!" said Master <span class="smcap">Southwell</span>, "have him to
the Marshalsea!"</p>

<p>"Have the gentleman to Newgate!" saith Master <span class="smcap">Gage</span>
again, "Call a couple of the Guard here."</p>

<p>"Ay," saith <span class="smcap">Bourne</span>, "and there shall be a letter sent to
the keeper how he shall use him; for we have other manner
of matters to him than these."</p>

<p>"So had ye need," said I, "or else I care not for you!"</p>

<p>"Deliver him to Master [<i>after Sir <span class="smcap">William</span></i>] <span class="smcap">Garrard</span>,
the Sheriff [of London]," said he, "and bid him send him to
Newgate."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said I, unto my Lord of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, (for that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was next to me) as they were rising, "I trust you will not
see me thus used, to be sent to Newgate. I am neither thief
nor traitor."</p>

<p>"You are a naughty fellow!" said he, "you were always
tutting in the Duke of <span class="smcap">Northumberland</span>'s ear, that you
were!"</p>

<p>"I would he had given better ear unto me," said I; "it
had not been with him then, as it is now" [<i>waiting his trial in</i>
<i>the Tower</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> passing by me, I thought good to prove
him; although he threatened me, before noon.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I pray you speak for me, that I be not
sent to Newgate; but rather unto the Fleet, which was first
named. I have not offended. I am a Gentleman, as you know;
and one of your fellows, when you were of that Band of the
Pensioners."</p>

<p>Very quietly, he said unto me, "I was not at the talk,
Master <span class="smcap">Underhill</span>; and therefore I can say nothing to it."
But I think he was well content with the place I was appointed
to.</p>

<p>So went I forth with my two fellows of the Guard, who
were glad they had the leading of me, for they were great
Papists.</p>

<p>"Where is that knave, the printer [<i>of the ballad</i>]?" said
Master <span class="smcap">Gage</span>.</p>

<p>"I know not," said I.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we came to the Tower gate, where Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Brydges</span> [<i>afterwards Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span> of Sudeley, see p. 128</i>] had
the charge, [who was there] with his brother Master <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>;
with whom I was well acquainted, (but not with Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>)
who, seeing the two of the Guard leading me, without their
halberts, rebuked them; and stayed me while they went for
their halberts.</p>

<p>His brother said unto me, "I am sorry you should be an
offender, Master <span class="smcap">Underhill</span>."</p>

<p>"I am none, Sir!" said I, "nor went I against the Queen."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said he.</p>

<p>And so forth we went at the gate, where was a great throng
of people to hear and see what prisoners were committed: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
amongst whom stood, my friend Master <span class="smcap">Ive</span>, the High Constable,
my next neighbour.</p>

<p>One of the Guard went forth at the wicket before me, to
take me by the arm, the other held me by the other arm;
fearing, belike, I would have shifted [<i>escaped</i>] from them
amongst the people.</p>

<p>When my friend, who had watched at the gate all the forenoon
saw me thus led; he followed afar off, as <span class="smcap">Peter</span> did
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, to see what should become of me. Many also followed,
some that knew me: some to learn who I was; for
that I was in a gown of satin.</p>

<p>Thus passed we through the streets, well accompanied,
unto Master <span class="smcap">Garrard</span>, the Sheriff's house, in the Stocks
Market. My friend Master <span class="smcap">Ive</span> tarried at the gate.</p>

<p>These two of the Guard declared unto Master Sheriff, that
they were commanded by the Council to deliver me unto him,
and he to send me unto Newgate: saying, "Sir, if it please
you, we will carry him thither."</p>

<p>With that, I stepped unto Master Sheriff, and, taking him
a little aside, requested him that, forasmuch as their commission
was but to deliver me unto him, and <i>he</i> to send me into
Newgate, that he would send me by his officers: for the
request was of mere malice.</p>

<p>"With a goodwill!" said Master Sheriff.</p>

<p>"Masters!" said he, "you may depart! I will send my
officers with this gentleman anon; when they be come in."</p>

<p>"We will see him carried, Sir!" said they, "for our discharge."</p>

<p>Then the Sheriff said sharply unto them, "What! do you
think that I will not do the Council's commandment? You
are discharged by delivering him unto me!"</p>

<p>With that, they departed.</p>

<p>My friend, Master <span class="smcap">Ive</span>, seeing them depart and leave me
behind, was very glad thereof: and tarried still at the gate
to see farther.</p>

<p>All this talk in the Sheriff's hall, did my Lord <span class="smcap">Russell</span>,
son and heir to the Earl of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>, hear and see; who was
at commandment [<i>under arrest</i>] in the Sheriff's house, and his
chamber joining into the hall, wherein he might look: who
was very sorry for me, for that I had been familiar with him
in matters of religion, as well on the other side the seas as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
at home. He sent me on the morrow, 20s. [= <i>about &pound;10 now</i>];
and every week as much, while I was in Newgate.</p>

<p>When these two companions of the Guard were gone, the
Sheriff sent two of his officers with me, who took no bills
with them, nor lead me; but followed a pretty way behind
me: for as I said unto Master Sheriff, "But for order's sake
and to save him blameless, I would have gone unto Newgate
myself, at the Council's commandment, or his either."</p>

<p>When I came into the street, my friend Master <span class="smcap">Ive</span>, seeing
me have such liberty, and such distance betwixt me and the
officers, he stepped before them, and so went talking with me
through Cheapside: so that it was not well perceived that I
was apprehended, but by the great company that followed.</p>

<p>The officers delivered me unto the Keeper of Newgate, as
they were commanded: who unlocked a door, and willed me
to go up the stairs into the Hall. My friend <span class="smcap">Ive</span> went up
with me; where we found three or four prisoners that had the
liberty of the house.</p>

<p>After a little talk with my friend, I required him not to let
my wife know that I was sent to Newgate, but [to say] to
the Counter, until such time that she were near her <i>churching</i>:
and that she should send me my night-gown, my <i>Bible</i>, and
my Lute. And so he departed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a while after, it was supper time [<i>i.e., about 5 p.m.</i>].
The board was covered in the same hall. The Keeper, whose
name was <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>, and his wife came to supper; and
half a dozen prisoners that were there for felonies: for I was
the first, for religion, that was sent unto that prison; but the
cause why, the Keeper knew not.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of those prisoners took acquaintance of [<i>recognised</i>]
me, and said, "He was a soldier under Sir <span class="smcap">Richard Cromwell</span>
in the journey [<i>in July, 1543</i>] to Landreci [in Hainault],
where he did know me and whose servant I was,
at the same time; and who, the next year following
[1544], when the famous King <span class="smcap">Henry</span> VIII. went unto
Boulogne, did put me unto his Majesty into the room of
a man-at-arms. Of the which Band, there were 200 of
us, upon barded horses, all in one suit of red and yellow
damask, the bards of our horses and plumes of feathers
of the same colours, to attend upon his Majesty for the
defence of his person."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>After supper, this good fellow whose name was <span class="smcap">Brystow</span>
procured me to have a bed in his chamber. He could play well
upon the rebeck [<i>violin</i>]. He was a tall man, and afterwards
of the Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s Guard, and yet a Protestant, which he
kept secret: "For else," he said, "he should not have found
such favour as he did at the Keeper's hands, and his wife's;
for to such as love the Gospel, they were very cruel."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I have sent for my <i>Bible</i>; and by GOD's
grace, therein shall be my daily exercise. I will not hide it
from them."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said he, "I am poor; but they will bear with you,
for that they see your estate is to pay well; and I will shew
you the nature and manner of them: for I have been here a
a good while. They both do love music very well; wherefore
you with your lute, and I to play with you on my rebeck,
will please them greatly. He loveth to be merry, and to
drink wine; and she also. If you will bestow upon them
every dinner and supper a quart of wine, and some music:
you shall be their white son, and have all the favour that
they can shew you!" And so it came to pass.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And now I think it good a little to digress from my
matter concerning my imprisonment and my deliverance;
and to note the great mercy of GOD shewed unto his
servants in that great Persecution in Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s
time: how mightily and how many ways he preserved
such as did fear Him, even as He preserved <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, and many in the old time.</p>

<p>Some were moved by His Spirit to flee over the seas.
Some were preserved still in London, that, in all the
time of persecution, never bowed their knees unto Baal:
for there was no such place to shift [<i>hide</i>] in, in this
realm, as London, notwithstanding their great spiall and
search; nor no better place to shift the Easter time
[<i>to avoid being houselled, i.e., taking the sacrament</i>] than in
Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s Court, serving in the room I did, as shall
be shewed hereafter [<i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_88">88</a>].</p>

<p>A great number, God did strengthen constantly to
stand to His Word, to glorify His name, which be
praised for ever and ever, world without end! And some
be preserved for these days.</p></div>

<p>And now again to prosecute the matter of my trouble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
wonderful deliverance out of that loathsome gaol of Newgate.</p>

<p>When that I had been there about two weeks [<i>5th-18th</i>
<i>August, 1553</i>], through the evil savours, and great unquietness
of the lodgings, as also by occasion of drinking of a draught
of strong Hollock [a sweet] wine, as I was going to bed,
which my chamber fellow would needs have me to pledge
him in, I was cast into an extreme burning ague, that I could
take no rest, and desiring to change my lodging. And so did,
from one to another, but none could I abide; there was so
many evil savours, and so much noise of prisoners.</p>

<p>The Keeper and his wife offered me his own parlour, where
he himself lay: which was furthest from noise; but it was
near the kitchen, the savour of which I could not abide.
Then did she lay me in a chamber, where she said never a
prisoner lay, which was her store chamber, where all her
plate and money lay; which was much.</p>

<p>So much friendship I found at their hands, notwithstanding
that they were spoken unto, by several Papists. And
the Woodmongers of London, with whom I had had a great
conflict for presenting them for false marking of billets;
they required the Keeper to show me no favour, and to lay
irons upon me, declaring that "I was the greatest heretic in
London."</p>

<p>My very friend Master <span class="smcap">Recorde</span>, Doctor of Physic,
singularly seen in all the seven sciences, and a great Divine,
visited me in the prison (to his great peril if it had been
known, who long time was at charges and pains with me,
gratis), and also after I was delivered. By means whereof,
and the Providence of GOD, I received my health.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My wife then was churched before her time, to be a suitor
for my deliverance; who put up a Supplication unto the
Council declaring my extreme sickness and small cause to be
committed unto so loathsome a gaol; requiring that I might
be delivered, putting in sureties to be forthcoming to answer
farther when I should be called. Which she obtained by the
help of Master [afterwards Sir] <span class="smcap">John Throgmorton</span>, being
the Master of the Requests, and my countryman [<i>i.e., of</i>
<i>Worcestershire</i>] and my kinsman. He, understanding who
were my enemies, took a time in their absence, and obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
[<i>on 21st August,1553</i>] a letter to the Keeper, subscribed by the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, [<span class="smcap">Stephen Gardiner</span>
the Bishop of] <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, [Sir <span class="smcap">Robert</span>] <span class="smcap">Rochester</span>
[Comptroller of the Household], and [Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span>] <span class="smcap">Waldegrave</span>,
to be delivered; putting in surety, according to the
request of my wife's Supplication.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With whom <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> talked, concerning the
christening of her child at the church at the Tower Hill;
and the gossips [<i>sponsors</i>], which were the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span>, and the Lady <span class="smcap">Jane</span>,
then being Queen: with the which, he [<i><span class="smcap">Gardiner</span></i>] was
much offended.</p>

<p>My Lady <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>, wife unto Sir <span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>
<span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>, was the Queen's deputy; who named
my son <span class="smcap">Guildford</span> after her [<i>the Queen's</i>] husband.</p>

<p>Immediately after the christening was done [<i>on the</i>
<i>19th of July, 1553</i>], Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span> was proclaimed in
Cheapside; and when my Lady <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span> came
into the Tower, the Cloth of Estate was taken down,
and all things defaced. A sudden change! She would
have gone forth again; but could not be suffered.</p></div>

<p>But now again to my matter.</p>

<p>When my wife had obtained the letter, joyful she was; and
brought her brother, <span class="smcap">John Speryne</span> of London, merchant,
with her; a very friendly man, and zealous in the LORD:
who was bound with me, according to the Council's letters
before Master <span class="smcap">Chedely</span>, Justice of the Peace: who came
into the prison unto me; for I was so sick and weak that I
was constrained to tarry a while longer, and my wife with me
day and night.</p>

<p>During all the time of my sickness, I was constrained to
pay 8<i>d.</i> [= <i>about</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d. now</i>] every meal; and as much for
my wife, and for every friend that came to see me, if they
were alone with me at dinner or supper time, whether they
came to the table or not; and paid also 40s. for a fine for
irons [<i>i.e., for not being chained</i>] which they said, "They
shewed me great favour in; I should have else paid &pound;4 or &pound;5."</p>

<p>Thus, when they perceived I did not amend, but rather
[grew] worse and worse; they thought it best to venture the
matter; and provided a horse litter to carry me home to
Limehurst. I was so weak that I was not able to get down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the stairs; wherefore one that was servant to the gaoler, who,
beforetime, had been my man, who was also very diligently
and friendly unto me, took me in his arms, and carried
me down the stairs to the horse-litter, which stood ready
at the prison door; and went with me to my house.</p>

<p>Many people were gathered to see my coming forth, who
praised GOD for my deliverance, being very sorry to see my
state, and the lamentation of my wife and her friends, who
judged I would not live until I came home.</p>

<p>I was not able to endure the going of the horse-litter,
wherefore they were fain to go very softly, and oftentimes
to stay; at which times, many of my acquaintances and
friends and others resorted to see me: so that it was two
hours ere we could pass from Newgate to Aldgate; and so
within night, before I could get to my house. Where many
of my neighbours resorted to see me taken out of the horse-litter;
who lamented and prayed for me, thinking it not possible
for me to escape death, but by the great mercy of GOD.</p>

<p>Thus I continued for the space of eight or ten days, without
any likelihood or hope of amendment.</p>

<p>I was sent to Newgate, the 5th day of August; and was
delivered the 5th day of September.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 1st day of October, was Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span> crowned; by
which time I was able to walk up and down my chamber.
Being very desirous to see the Queen pass through the City, I
got up on horseback, being scant able to sit, girded in a
long night-gown; with double kerchiefs about my head, a
great hat upon them; my beard dubbed [<i>clotted</i>] hard too. My
face so lean and pale that I was the very Image of Death;
wondered at of all that did behold me; and unknown to any.
My wife and neighbours were too too sorry that I would needs
go forth; thinking I would not return alive.</p>

<p>Thus went I forth, having on either side of me a man to
stay [<i>uphold</i>] me; and so went to the West end of Paul's; and
there placed myself amongst others that sat on horseback to
see the Queen pass by.</p>

<p>Before her coming, I beheld Paul's steeple bearing top and
top-gallant [yards] like a royal ship, with many flags and
banners: and a man [<i><span class="smcap">Peter</span>, a Dutchman</i>] triumphing and
dancing in the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I said unto one that sat on horseback by me, who
had not seen any coronation, "At the coronation of King
<span class="smcap">Edward</span>, I saw Paul's steeple lie at anchor, and now she
weareth top and top-gallant. Surely, the next will be
shipwreck, ere it be long!" which chanceth sometimes
by tempestuous winds, sometimes by lightnings and fire
from heaven.</p>

<p>But I thought that it should rather perish with some
horrible wind, than with lightning or thunderbolt
[<i>evidently alluding to the destruction by lightning of the</i>
<i>Steeple, on the 4th June,1561</i>]; but such are the wonderful
works of GOD, whose gunners will not miss the mark
that He doth appoint, be it never so little.</p></div>

<p>When the Queen passed by, many beheld me, for they
might almost touch me, the room [<i>space</i>] was so narrow;
marvelling, belike, that one in such a state would venture
forth. Many of my fellows the Pensioners, and others, and
divers of the Council beheld me: and none of them all knew
me.</p>

<p>I might hear them say one to another, "There is one that
loveth the Queen well, belike; for he ventureth greatly to
see her. He is very like never to see her more." Thus my
men whose hearing was quicker than mine, that stood by me,
heard many of them say.</p>

<p>The Queen herself, when she passed by, beheld me. Thus
much I thought good to write, to shew how GOD doth preserve
that which seemeth to man impossible; as many that
day did judge of me. Thus returned I home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And about two months after [<i>i.e., in December</i>], I was able
to walk to London at an easy pace; but still with my kerchiefs
and pale lean face. I muffled me with a sarsenet, which the
rude people in the streets would murmur at, saying, "What
is he? Dare he not show his face?"</p>

<p>I did repair to my old familiar acquaintance, as drapers,
mercers, and others: and stood talking with them, and
cheapened their wares; and there was not one of them that
knew me.</p>

<p>Then would I say unto them, "Do you not know me?
Look better upon me! Do you not know my voice?" For
that also was altered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Truly," would they say, "you must pardon me! I cannot
call you to remembrance."</p>

<p>Then would I declare my name unto them; whereat they
so marvelled, that they could scarcely credit me, but for the
familiar acquaintance that I put them in remembrance of.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus passed I forth the time at Limehurst until Christmas
[1553] was passed, then I waxed something strong. I then
thought it best to shift from thence; for that I had there
fierce enemies; especially [<span class="smcap">Henry More</span> the Vicar of
Stepney, Abbot <i>quondam</i> of St. Mary de Grace on Tower
Hill. <i>He died in November, 1554.</i>]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whom I apprehended in King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>'s time, and
carried him to Croydon to <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>, Bishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>,
for that he disturbed the Preachers in his Church [<i>at</i>
<i>Stepney</i>] causing the bells to be rung when they were at
the Sermon; and sometimes begin to sing in the Choir
before the sermon were half done, and sometimes challenge
the Preacher in the Pulpit. For he was a strong
stout Popish prelate: whom the godly men of the parish
were weary of; specially my neighbours of the Limehurst,
as Master <span class="smcap">Driver</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Ive</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Pointer</span>,
Master <span class="smcap">Marche</span>, and others.</p>

<p>Yet durst they not meddle with him, until it was my hap
to come and dwell amongst them: and for that I was the
King's Servant, I took it upon me; and they went with
me to the Bishop to witness those things against him.
Who was too full of lenity. A little he rebuked him,
and bad him do no more so.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said I, "methinks, you are too gentle
unto so stout a Papist!"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "we have no law to punish them by."</p>

<p>"We have, my Lord!" said I. "If I had your
authority, I would be so bold to un-Vicar him; or minister
some sharp punishment unto him, and such other. If
ever it come to their turn; they will show you no such
favour."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "if GOD so provide, we must abide it."</p>

<p>"Surely," said I, "GOD will never cone you thank
for this; but rather take the sword from such as will not
use it upon His enemies." And thus we departed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<p>The like favour is shewed now [<i>i.e., in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s</i>
<i>reign</i>]; and therefore the like plague will follow.</p>

<p>There was also another spiteful enemy at Stepney,
called <span class="smcap">Banbery</span>, a shifter, a dicer, &amp;c., like unto <span class="smcap">Dapers</span>
the dicer, <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> of Salisbury Court, busking [Sir
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, <i>also called</i> Long] <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, lusty <span class="smcap">Young</span>, [Sir]
<span class="smcap">Ralph Bagnall</span> [<i>see Vol. III. p. 147</i>], [Sir] <span class="smcap">Miles Partridge</span>
[<i>idem</i>], and such others. With which companions,
I was conversant a while; until I fell to reading the
Scriptures, and following the Preachers.</p>

<p>Then, against the wickedness of those men, which
I had seen among them; I put forth a ballet, uttering the
falsehood and knavery that I was made privy unto.
For the which, they so hated me that they raised false
slanders and bruits of me, saying that "I was a spy for
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Northumberland</span>": and calling me
[Bishop] "<span class="smcap">Hooper</span>'s companion," for a bill that I set
up upon Paul's gate, in defence of <span class="smcap">Hooper</span>; and another
at St. Magnus's Church, where he was too much abused,
with railing bills cast into the pulpit and other ways.</p>

<p>Thus became I odious unto most men, and many times
in danger of my life, even in King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>'s days. As
also for apprehending one <span class="smcap">Allen</span>, a false prophesier
[<i>of whom <span class="smcap">Underhill</span> says elsewhere</i>, This <span class="smcap">Robert</span>
<span class="smcap">Allen</span> was called the God of Norfolk, before they received
the light of the Gospel]; who bruited [<i>in January,</i>
<i>1551</i>] that King <span class="smcap">Edward</span> was dead, two years before it
came to pass; who was a great calculator for the same.
But these jugglers and wicked dicers were still in favour
among the magistrates, and were advanced; who were the
sowers of sedition, and the destroyers of the two Dukes.</p>

<p>I pray God the like be not practised by such flatterers
in these days [<i>i.e., in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s reign</i>], according to
the old proverb, "He that will in Court dwell, must curry
Fauvell." And</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>He that will in Court abide,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Must curry Fauvell back and side,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[<i>i.e.</i>, he must curry or groom a horse, of Fauvell (a bright yellow or
tawny) colour (opposed to Sorell, a dark colour), back and side.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>for such get most gain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<p>I was also called "the hot Gospeller!" jesting and
mocking me, saying, "He is all of the Spirit!"</p>

<p>This was their common custom, at their tables, to
jest and mock the Preachers and earnest followers of the
Gospel; even among the magistrates: or else [speak] in
wanton and ribald talk; which when they fell into, one
or other would look through [<i>along</i>] the board, saying,
"Take heed that <span class="smcap">Underhill</span> be not here!"</p>

<p>At Stratford on the Bow [<i>now Stratford at Bow</i>], I
took the pix of the altar; being of copper, stored with
copper gods: the Curate being present, and a Popish
Justice dwelling in the town, called Justice <span class="smcap">Tawe</span>.</p>

<p>There was commandment it should not hang in a
string over the altar; and then, they set it upon the
altar.</p>

<p>For this act, the Justice's wife with the women of the
town, conspired to have murdered me; which one of
them gave me warning of, whose good will to the Gospel
was not unknown unto the rest. Thus the Lord preserved
me from them, and many other dangers more; but
specially from hell fire, but that, of His mercy, He called
me from the company of the wicked.</p></div>

<p>This <span class="smcap">Banbery</span>, aforesaid, was the spy for Stepney parish;
as <span class="smcap">John Avales</span>, <span class="smcap">Beard</span>, and such others were for London:
who [<i>i.e., <span class="smcap">Banbery</span></i>]caused my friend and neighbour Master
<span class="smcap">Ive</span> to be sent unto the Marshalsea, but the LORD shortly
delivered him. Wherefore I thought it best to avoid [<i>leave</i>];
because my not coming to the church there, should by him be
marked and presented.</p>

<p>Then took I a little house in a secret corner, at the nether
[<i>lower</i>] end of Wood Street; where I might better shift the
matter.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Humphrey Ratcliffe</span> was the Lieutenant of the
Pensioners, and always favoured the Gospel; by whose
means I had my wages still paid me [<i>70 marks a year</i> = &pound;46
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> = <i>about</i> &pound;500 <i>now; besides a free diet</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When [Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>] <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span> was come to Southwark [<i>6th</i>
<i>February, 1554</i>] the Pensioners were commanded to watch in
armour that night, at the Court: which I hearing of, thought
it best, in like sort, to be there; lest by my absence I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
have some quarrel piked unto [<i>picked with</i>] me; or, at the
least, be stricken out of the book for receiving any more
wages.</p>

<p>After supper, I put on my armour as the rest did; for we
were appointed to watch all the night.</p>

<p>So, being all armed, we came up into the Chamber of
Presence, with our pole-axes in our hands. Wherewith the
Ladies were very fearful. Some lamenting, crying, and
wringing their hands, said, "Alas, there is some great mischief
toward! We shall all be destroyed this night! What
a sight is this! to see the Queen's Chamber full of armed
men. The like was never seen, nor heard of!"</p>

<p>The Master [<span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Norris</span>, who was a Gentleman Usher
of the Utter [<i>Outer</i>] Chamber in King <span class="smcap">Henry</span> VIII.'s time,
and all King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>'s time; always a rank Papist, and
therefore was now Chief Usher of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s Privy
Chamber: he was appointed to call the Watch, and see if any
were lacking. Unto whom, <span class="smcap">Moore</span>, the Clerk of our Cheque,
delivered the book of our names; which he perused before he
would call them at the cupboard. And when he came to my
name, "What!" said he, "what doth he here?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Clerk, "he is here ready to serve as the
rest be."</p>

<p>"Nay, by God's body!" said he, "that heretic shall not
be called to watch here! Give me a pen!" So he struck out
my name out of the book.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Cheque sought me out, and said unto me,
"Master <span class="smcap">Underhill</span>, you need not to watch! you may depart
to your lodging!"</p>

<p>"May I?" said I, "I would be glad of that," thinking I
had been favoured, because I was not recovered from my
sickness: but I did not well trust him, because he was also
a Papist. "May I depart indeed?" said I, "will you be my
discharge?"</p>

<p>"I tell you true," said he, "Master <span class="smcap">Norris</span> hath stricken
you out of the book, saying these words, 'That heretic
shall not watch here!' I tell you true what he said."</p>

<p>"Marry, I thank him!" said I, "and you also! You
could not do me a greater pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Nay, burden not me withal!" said he, "it is not my
doing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>So departed I into the Hall, where our men were appointed
to watch. I took my men with me, and a link; and went
my ways.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I came to the Court gate, there I met with Master
<span class="smcap">Clement Throgmorton</span> [<i>father of <span class="smcap">Job Throgmorton</span>, the</i>
<i>Martinist of 1589</i>], and <span class="smcap">George Ferrers</span> [<i>the Poet and Historian;</i>
<i>see p.</i> 173], tending their links, to go to London.
Master <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span> was come post from Coventry; and
had been with the Queen to declare unto her the taking of
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>. Master <span class="smcap">Ferrers</span> was sent from the
Council unto the Lord <span class="smcap">William Howard</span>, who had the
charge of the watch at London Bridge.</p>

<p>As we went, for that they were both my friends and
Protestants, I told them of my good hap, and manner of discharge
of the Watch at the Court.</p>

<p>When we came to Ludgate, it was past eleven o'clock.
The gate was fast locked; and a great watch within the gate
of Londoners, but none without: whereof <span class="smcap">Henry Peckham</span>
had the charge, under his father; who, belike, was gone to
his father, or to look to the water side.</p>

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span> knocked hard, and called to them,
saying, "Here are three or four gentlemen come from the
Court that must come in; and therefore open the gate!"</p>

<p>"Who?" quoth one, "What?" quoth another; and much
laughing they made.</p>

<p>"Can ye tell what you do, sirs?" said Master <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>,
declaring his name, and that he had been with the
Queen to shew her Grace of the taking of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>, "and my lodging is within, as I am sure, some of
you do know!"</p>

<p>"And," said <span class="smcap">Ferrers</span>, "I am <span class="smcap">Ferrers</span>, that was Lord of
Misrule with King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>; and am sent from the Council
unto my Lord <span class="smcap">William</span>, who hath charge of the Bridge as
you know, upon weighty affairs: and therefore let us in, or
else ye be not the Queen's friends!"</p>

<p>Still there was much laughing amongst them.</p>

<p>Then said two or three of them, "We have not the keys.
We are not trusted with them. The keys be carried away
for this night."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" said Master <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
weary and faint, and I now wax cold. I am not acquainted
hereabout; nor no man dare open his doors at this dangerous
time; nor am I able to go back again to the Court. I shall
perish this night!"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "Let us go to Newgate! I think I shall
get in there."</p>

<p>"Tush!" said he, "it is but in vain. We shall be answered
there as we are here."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "and [<i>if</i>] the worst fall, I can lodge ye in
Newgate. Ye know what acquaintance I have there! and the
Keeper's door is without the gate."</p>

<p>"That were a bad shift!" said he, "I had almost as leave
die in the streets; yet I will, rather than wander again to the
Court."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "let us go and prove! I believe the
Keeper will help us in at the gate, or else let us in through
his wards, for he hath a door on the inside also. If all this
fail, I have a friend at the gate, <span class="smcap">Newman</span> the ironmonger; in
whose house I have been lodged: where, I dare warrant you,
we shall have lodging, or at the least, house-room and fire."</p>

<p>"Marry, this is well said!" saith <span class="smcap">Ferrers</span>.</p>

<p>So to Newgate, we went: where was a great Watch without
the gate, which my friend <span class="smcap">Newman</span> had the charge of; for
that he was the Constable. They marvelled to see there,
torches coming at that time of the night.</p>

<p>When we came to them, "Master <span class="smcap">Underhill</span>," said
<span class="smcap">Newman</span>, "what news, that you walk so late?"</p>

<p>"None but good!" said I, "We come from the Court, and
would have gone in at Ludgate, and cannot be let in: wherefore,
I pray you, if you cannot help us in here, let us have
lodging with you!"</p>

<p>"Marry, that ye shall!" said he, "or go in at the gate
whether ye will!"</p>

<p>"Godamercy, gentle friend!" said Master <span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>;
"I pray you let us go in, if it may be!"</p>

<p>He called to the Constable within the gate, who opened
the gate forthwith. "How happy was I!" said Master
<span class="smcap">Throgmorton</span>, "that I met with you. I had been lost
else."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span> was come about [<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><i>i.e., from Southwark, through</i>
<i>Kingston, to Westminster on 7th February 1554</i>], notwithstanding
my discharge of the watch by Master <span class="smcap">Norris</span>, I put
on my armour, and went to the Court [<i>at Whitehall Palace</i>]:
where I found all my fellows in the Hall, which they were
appointed to keep that day.</p>

<p>Old Sir <span class="smcap">John Gage</span> was appointed without the utter [<i>outer</i>]
gate, with some of his Guard, and his servants and others with
him. The rest of the Guard were in the Great Court, the gates
standing open. Sir <span class="smcap">Richard Southwell</span> had charge of the
back sides, as the Wood Yard and that way, with 500 men.</p>

<p>The Queen was in the Gallery by the Gatehouse.</p>

<p>Then came <span class="smcap">Knevett</span> and <span class="smcap">Thomas Cobham</span> with a company
of the rebels with them, through the Gatehouse from
Westminster: wherewith Sir <span class="smcap">John Gage</span> and three of the
Judges [of the Common Pleas] that were meanly armed in
old brigantines [<i>jackets of quilted leather, covered with iron</i>
<i>plates</i>] were so frighted, that they fled in at the gates in such
haste, that old <span class="smcap">Gage</span> fell down in the dirt and was foul
arrayed: and so shut the gates, whereat the rebels shot many
arrows.</p>

<p>By means of this great hurly burly in shutting of the gates,
the Guard that were in the Court made as great haste in
at the Hall door; and would have come into the Hall amongst
us, which we would not suffer. Then they went thronging
towards the Water Gate, the kitchens, and those ways.</p>

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Gage</span> came in amongst us, all dirt; and so
frighted that he could not speak to us. Then came the three
Judges; so frighted that we could not keep them out, except
we should beat them down.</p>

<p>With that we issued out of the Hall into the Court, to see
what the matter was; where there were none left but the
porters, the gates being fast shut. As we went towards the
gate, meaning to go forth, Sir <span class="smcap">Richard Southwell</span> came
forth of the back yards into the Court.</p>

<p>"Sir!" said we, "command the gates to be opened that
we may go to the Queen's enemies! We will else break them
open! It is too much shame that the gates should thus be
shut for a few rebels! The Queen shall see us fell down her
enemies this day, before her face!"</p>

<p>"Masters!" said he, and put his morion off his head, "I
shall desire you all, as you be Gentlemen, to stay yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
here; that I may go up to the Queen to know her pleasure;
and you shall have the gates opened. And, as I am a Gentleman!
I will make speed!"</p>

<p>Upon this, we stayed; and he made a speedy return: and
brought us word, the Queen was content that we should have
the gates opened: "But her request is," said he, "that you
will not go forth of her sight; for her only trust is in you, for
the defence of her person this day."</p>

<p>So the gate was opened, and we marched before the Gallery
window: where she spake unto us; requiring us, "As we
were Gentlemen, in whom she only trusted, that we would
not go from that place."</p>

<p>There we marched up and down the space of an hour; and
then came a herald posting, to bring the news that <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>
was taken.</p>

<p>Immediately came Sir <span class="smcap">Maurice Berkeley</span> and <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>
behind him; unto whom he did yield at the Temple Gate:
and <span class="smcap">Thomas Cobham</span> behind another gentleman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Anon after, we [<i>the Gentlemen Pensioners</i>] were all brought
unto the Queen's presence, and every one kissed her hand;
of whom we had great thanks and large promises how good
she would be unto us: but few or none of us got anything,
although she was very liberal to many others, that were
enemies unto GOD's Word, as few of us were.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus went I home to my house, where[in] I kept, and came
little abroad, until the marriage was concluded with King
<span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</p>

<p>Then was there [the] preparing [<i>in July, 1555</i>] to go with
the Queen, unto Winchester; and all the Books of the
Ordinaries were perused by [<span class="smcap">Stephen Gardiner</span>] the Bishop
of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> and the Earl of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, to consider of
every man.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Humphrey Ratcliffe</span>, our Lieutenant, brought unto
him the Book of the Pensioners; which when they overlooked,
they came unto my name.</p>

<p>"What doth he here?" said the Earl of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>.</p>

<p>"I know no cause why he should not be here," said Master
<span class="smcap">Ratcliffe</span>, "he is an honest man. He hath served from
the beginning of the Band [<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span><i>founded in December, 1539, as the</i>
<i>Band of Spears. It consisted of a Captain, Lieutenant, Standard</i>
<i>bearer, Clerk of the Cheque, and Gentleman Harbinger, and fifty</i>
<i>Gentlemen; chosen out of the best and most ancient families of</i>
<i>England. Some of them sons to Earls, Barons, Knights, and</i>
<i>Esquires: men thereunto specially recommended for their worthiness</i>
<i>and sufficiency; without any stain or taint of dishonour, or</i>
<i>disparagement in blood</i>], and was as forward as any to serve the
Queen, in the time of <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>'s rebellion."</p>

<p>"Let him pass then!" said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Earl, "you may do so; but I assure you,
my Lord! he is an arch-heretic!"</p>

<p>Thus I passed once again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we came to Winchester, being in the Chamber of
Presence, with my fellows, Master <span class="smcap">Norris</span> came forth of the
Queen's Privy Chamber; unto whom we did reverence, as
his place required.</p>

<p>"What!" saith he unto me; "what do you here?"</p>

<p>"Marry, sir!" said I, "what do you here?"</p>

<p>"Eh!" said he, "are you so short with me?"</p>

<p>"Sir!" said I, "I must and will forbear, for the place you
be in; but if you were in the place you were in, of the Outer
Chamber, I would be shorter with you! You were then the
doorkeeper; when we waited at the table. Your office is not
to find fault at my being here. I am at this time appointed
to serve here, by those that be in authority; who know me,
as well as you do!"</p>

<p>"They shall know you better!" said he, "and the Queen
also."</p>

<p>With that, said Master <span class="smcap">John Calveley</span>, one of my fellows
(brother unto Sir <span class="smcap">Hugh Calveley</span>, of Cheshire), who served
at the journey to Laundercei in the same Band that I did,
"In good faith! Master <span class="smcap">Norris</span>, methinks you do not well!
This gentleman, our fellow, hath served of long time, and
was ready to venture his life in defence of the Queen's Majesty
at the last service, and as forward as any was there; and
also being appointed and ready to serve here again now,
to his great charges, as it is unto us all, methinks you do other
than the part of a Gentleman thus to seek him!"</p>

<p>"What!" said he, "I perceive you will hold together!"</p>

<p>"Else we were worse than beasts," said my fellow; "if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
would not, in all lawful cases, so hold together; he that
toucheth one of us, shall touch all."</p>

<p>So went he from us, into the Privy Chamber; and from
that time never meddled more with me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the marriage day [<i>25th July, 1555, at Winchester</i>], the King
and the Queen dined in the hall in the Bishop's Palace;
sitting under the Cloth of Estate, and none else at that table.
The Nobility sat at the side tables. We were the chief
servitors, to carry the meat; and the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, our
Captain, was the Sewer.</p>

<p>The second course at the marriage of a King is given unto
the bearers; I mean the meat, but not the dishes, for they
were of gold.</p>

<p>It was my chance to carry a great pasty of a red deer in a
great charger, very delicately baked; which, for the weight
thereof, divers refused [<i>i.e., to carry</i>]. The which pasty I sent
unto London, to my wife and her brother; who cheered therewith
many of their friends.</p>

<p>I will not take upon me, to write the manner of the marriage,
of the feast, nor of the dancing of the Spaniards, that
day; who were greatly out of countenance, specially King
<span class="smcap">Philip</span> dancing with the Queen, when they did see my Lord
<span class="smcap">Bray</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Carew</span>, and others so far exceed them; but
will leave it unto the learned, as it behoveth him to be, that
shall write a Story of so great a Triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Which being ended, their repair was to London. Where,
shortly after, began the cruel persecution of the Preachers
and earnest professors and followers of the Gospel; and
searching of men's houses for their books. Wherefore I got
old <span class="smcap">Henry Daunce</span>, the bricklayer of Whitechapel; who
used to preach the Gospel in his garden, every holiday, where
I have seen a thousand people: he did inclose my books in a
brick wall by the chimney's side in my chamber; where they
were preserved from moulding or mice, until the first year
of our most gracious Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that, I removed from thence, and went
unto Coventry; and got me a house a mile out of that city in
a wood side. But before I removed from the said house [<i>in</i>
<i>Wood Street</i>] in London; I had two children born there, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
wench [<i>i.e., a girl, his fifth daughter, <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, born 4th January,</i>
<i>1554</i>], and a boy [<i>his second son, <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, born 10th February,</i>
<i>1555</i>].</p>

<p>It was a great grief to me, to see so much innocent blood
shed for the Verity. I was also threatened by <span class="smcap">John Avales</span>
and <span class="smcap">Beard</span>: which I understood by Master <span class="smcap">Luke [Shepherd]</span>,
my very friend, of Coleman Street, physician; who was great
with some that kept them company, and yet were honest
men. Whom I caused to let them understand, that "If they
did attempt to take me, except they had a warrant signed
with four or five of the Council's hands, I would go further
with them than <span class="smcap">Peter</span> did, who strake off but the ear of
<span class="smcap">Malchus</span>; but I would surely strike off head and all."
Which was declared unto them; so that I oftentimes met
them, but they would not meddle with me. So mightily the
merciful LORD defended me; as also from being present at
that blasphemous <i>Mass</i>, in all the time of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This <span class="smcap">Luke [Shepherd]</span> wrote many proper books
against the Papists, for the which he was imprisoned
in the Fleet; especially a book called <i><span class="smcap">John Bon</span> and</i>
<i>mast. Person</i>, who reasoned together of the natural presence
in the Sacrament [<i>see pp. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>-<a href="#Page_111">111</a></i>]. Which book he
wrote in the time of King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>; wherewith the
Papists were sore grieved, specially <span class="smcap">Sir John Gresham</span>,
then being Mayor [<i>i.e., October 1547-October 1548; but the</i>
<i>true date of <span class="smcap">Allen</span>'s arrest would appear, from p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, to have</i>
<i>been in 1551; when Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew Judde</span> was Lord Mayor</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Day</span> did print the same book [<i>? in 1551</i>]; whom
the Mayor sent for, to know the maker [<i>author</i>] thereof
saying "He should also go to prison, for printing the
same."</p>

<p>It was my chance to come in the same time; for that
I had found out where <span class="smcap">[Robert] Allen</span> the Prophesier,
had a chamber; through whom there was a bruit in the
city, that the King was dead: which I declared to the
Mayor, requiring him to have an Officer to apprehend
him.</p>

<p>"Marry," said the Mayor, "I have received letters to
make search for such this night at midnight."</p>

<p>He was going unto dinner; who willed me to take part
of the same.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<p>As we were at dinner, he said "There was a book put
forth, called <span class="smcap">John Bon</span>; the maker whereof, he would
gladly search for."</p>

<p>"Why so?" said I, "that book is a good book. I
have one of them here, and there are many of them in
the Court."</p>

<p>"Have you so?" said he, "I pray you, let me see it;
for I have not seen any of them."</p>

<p>So he took it, and read a little of it, and laughed
thereat, as it was both pithy and merry. By means
whereof, <span class="smcap">John Day</span>, sitting at a sideboard after dinner,
was bidden [to] go home; who had, else, gone to prison.</p>

<p>When we had dined, the Mayor sent two of his
Officers with me to seek <span class="smcap">Allen</span>; whom we met withal
in Paul's [Church], and took him with us unto his
chamber; where we found figures set to calculate the
nativity of the King, and a judgement given of his death;
whereof this foolish wretch thought himself so sure,
that he, and his counsellors the Papists, bruited it all
over.</p>

<p>The King lay at Hampton Court, the same time; and
my Lord Protector [<i>the Duke of <span class="smcap">Northumberland</span></i>]
at the Sion [<i>Sion House, near Isleworth</i>]; unto whom
I carried this <span class="smcap">Allen</span>, with his books of conjurations,
calculations, and many things belonging to that devilish
art: which he affirmed before my Lord, "was a lawful
science, for the statute [<i>33 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</i>] against
such was repealed [by 1 <i>Edw. VI. c. 12</i>]."</p>

<p>"Thou foolish knave!" said my Lord, "if thou, and
all that be of thy science tell me what I shall do to-morrow,
I will give thee all that I have!" Commanding
me to carry him unto the Tower: and wrote a
letter to Sir <span class="smcap">John Markham</span>, then being Lieutenant, to
cause him to be examined by such as were learned.</p>

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Markham</span>, as he was both wise and zealous
in the LORD, talked with him. Unto whom he did
affirm that "He knew more of the science of Astronomy
than all the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge."
Whereupon he sent for my friend, before spoken of,
Doctor <span class="smcap">Recorde</span>; who examined him: and he knew
not the rules of Astronomy; but "Was a very unlearned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
ass; and a sorcerer, for the which he was worthy hanging,"
said Master <span class="smcap">Recorde</span>.</p>

<p>To have further matters unto [<i>in reference to</i>] him, we
sent for <span class="smcap">Thomas Robyns</span> <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, commonly called
Little <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> or <span class="smcap">Tom Morgan</span> (brother unto great [<i>big</i>]
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, of Salisbury Court, the great dicer); who, when
I was a companion with him, told me many stories of
this <span class="smcap">Allen</span>: what a cunning man he was! and what
things he could do! as, to make a woman love a man, to
teach men how to win at the dice, what should become
of this realm; there was nothing, but he knew it! So
he had his chambers in divers places of the city, whither
resorted many women, for things stolen or lost, to know
their fortunes, and their children's fortunes; where the
ruffling roister[er]s and dicers made their ma[t]ches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When this <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> and <span class="smcap">Allen</span> were brought together;
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> utterly denied that ever he had seen him, or
known him.</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="smcap">Allen</span>, "you know me! and I know you!"
For he had confessed that, before his coming.</p>

<p>Upon this, Master Lieutenant stayed Little <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
also a prisoner in the Tower.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I caused also Master <span class="smcap">Gaston</span> the lawyer [<i>not to be confounded</i>
<i>with <span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span> the Poet, of Gray's Inn; who did</i>
<i>not marry Widow <span class="smcap">Breton</span> till after 13th June, 1559</i>], who
was also a great dicer, to be apprehended. In whose
house, <span class="smcap">Allen</span> was much; and had a chamber there,
where many things were practised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaston</span> had an old wife, who was laid under the board
all night, for dead; and when the women, in the morning,
came to wind her, they found that there was life in her;
and so recovered her: and she lived about two years
after.</p>

<p>By the resort of such as came to seek for things
stolen and lost, which they would hide for the nonce, to
blear their husband's eyes withal, [afterwards] saying,
"the wise man told them"; of such, <span class="smcap">Gaston</span> had choice
for himself and his friends, young lawyers of the Temple
[, <i>not of Gray's Inn</i>].</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<p>Thus became I so despised and odious unto the
lawyers, Lords and ladies, gentlemen, merchants, knaves,
and thieves; that I walked as dangerously as <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>
amongst the lions. Yet from them all, the LORD delivered
me: notwithstanding their often devices and
conspiracies by violence to have shed my blood, or with

that I may apply myself for the keeping
of the same, as long as I live! Give me such
wisdom that I may understand, and so to fulfil the
thing that Thy law deviseth! to keep it also with my whole
heart, that I do nothing against it! Guide me after the true
understanding of Thy commandments! for that hath been
always my special desire. Incline mine heart unto the love
of Thy statutes, and cause me utterly to abhor covetousness!
Turn mine eyes aside! lest they be 'tangled with the love of
most vain things; but lead me, rather, unto life through Thy
warnings! Set such a Word before Thy servant, as may
most chiefly further him to worship Thee! Take away the
shame that I am afraid of! for Thy judgements are greatly
mixed with mercy. As for me, verily, I have loved Thy
commandments; wherefore keep me alive according to Thy
righteousness!</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">First</span>, therefore, to begin with her princely birth,
being born at Greenwich, <i>anno</i> 1534, of the famous
and victorious Prince, King <span class="smcap">Henry</span> VIII., and of
the noble and most virtuous Lady, Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span>
her mother; sufficiently is committed to the story
before. Also of the solemn celebration of her baptism in the
said town, and Grey Friar's Church, of Greenwich; having
to her godfather, <span class="smcap">Thomas Cranmer</span>, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>After that, she was committed to godly tutors and governors.
Under whose institution her Grace did so greatly
increase, or rather excel in all manner of virtue and knowledge
of learning, that I stand in a doubt whether is more to
be commended in this behalf, the studious diligence of them
that brought her up, or the singular towardness of her own
princely nature to all virtuous disposition; so apt and so
inclinable: both being notwithstanding the gifts of GOD, for
which we are all bound to give Him thanks. What tongue
is it that Her Grace knoweth not? What language she
cannot speak? What liberal art or science, she hath not
learned? And what virtue wherewith her noble breast is not
garnished? In counsel and wisdom, what Councillor will go
beyond Her Majesty?</p>

<p>If the goodness of nature, joined with the industry of Her
Grace's institution, had not been in her marvellous, how
many things were there, besides the natural infirmity of that
sex, the tenderness of youth, the nobility of estate, allurements
of the world, persuasions of flatterers, abundance of
wealth and pleasures, examples of the Court, enough to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
her Grace away after the common fashion and rule of many
other Ladies, from gravity to lightness, from study to ease,
from wisdom to vanity, from religion to superstition, from
godliness to gawishness, to be pricked up with pride, to be
garish in apparel, to be fierce in condition?</p>

<p>Eloquently is it spoken, and discreetly meant of <span class="smcap">Tully</span>,
the eloquent orator: "To live," saith he, "a good man in
other places, is no great matter: but in Asia, to keep a sober
and temperate life, that is a matter indeed praiseworthy!" So
here, why may I not affirm without flattery, that [which]
every man's conscience can testify? In that age, that sex,
in such State and fortune, in so great occasions, so many
incitements: in all these, to retain so sober conversation, so
temperate condition, such mildness of manners, such humbleness
of stomach, such clemency in forgiving, such travailing
in study: briefly, in the midst of Asia, so far to degenerate
from all Asia; it hath not lightly been seen in Europe!
Hitherto, it hath been seen in very few. Whereby it may
appear not only what education, or what Nature may do; but
what GOD, above Nature, hath wrought in her noble breast,
adorning it with so worthy virtues.</p>

<p>Of which her princely qualities and virtuous disposition,
such as have been conversant with her youth can better
testify. That which I have seen and read, I trust I may
boldly repeat without suspicion either of feigning or flattery.
For so I have read, written, and testified of Her Grace by
[<i>according to</i>] one, both learned and also that can say something
in this matter. Who in a certain book, by him set
forth, entreating of Her Grace's virtuous bringing up, what
discreet, sober, and godly women she had about her;
speaketh, namely, of two points in Her Grace to be considered.
One concerning her moderate and maidenly behaviour;
the other one concerning her training up in learning
and good letters. Declaring, first, for her virtuous moderation
of life, that seven years after her father's death [<i>i.e. in</i>
<i>1553</i>], she had no little pride of stomach, so little delight in
glistering gazes of the world, in gay apparel, rich attire, and
precious jewels, that in all that time [<i>i.e., through her brother</i>
<i><span class="smcap">Edward</span>'s reign</i>] she never looked upon those, that her father
left her (and which other Ladies commonly be so fond upon)
but only once; and that against her will. And, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
after that, so little gloried in the same, that there came
neither gold nor store upon her head, till her sister enforced
her to lay off her former soberness, and bear her company in
her glistening gains: yea, and then, she so ware it, as every
man might see that her body bare that which her heart
misliked. Wherein the virtuous prudence of this Princess,
not reading but following the words of <span class="smcap">Paul</span> and <span class="smcap">Peter</span>,
well considered True Nobility to consist not in circumstances
of the body, but in substance of the heart; not in such things
which deck the body, but in that which dignifieth the mind,
shining and blazing more bright than pearl or stone, be it
never so precious.</p>

<p>Again, the said author, further proceeding in the same
matter, thus testifieth, that he knew a great man's daughter
receiving from the Lady <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, before she was Queen, goodly
apparel of tinsel, cloth of gold and velvet, laid on with
parchment lace of gold. When she saw it she said, "What
shall I do with it?"</p>

<p>"Marry!" said a gentlewoman, "wear it!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" quoth she, "that were a shame! To follow my
Lady <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, against GOD's Word; and leave my Lady
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, which followeth GOD's Word."</p>

<p>Let noble Ladies and gentlewomen here learn either to
give, or to take good example given: and if they disdain to
teach their inferiors, in well doing; yet, let it not shame
them, to learn of their betters.</p>

<p>Likewise also at the coming in of the Scottish Queen [<i>in</i>
<i>1553</i>], when all the other Ladies of the Court flourished in
their bravery, with their hair frounced and curled, and double
curled; yet she altered nothing; but to the shame of them
all, kept her old maidenly shamefastness.</p>

<p>Let us now come to the second point, declaring how she
hath been trained in learning; and that not vulgar and
common, but the purest and the best, which is most commended
at these days, as the Tongues, Arts, and GOD's
Word. Wherein she so exceedingly profited, as the foresaid
author doth witness, that being under twenty years of age
[<i>i.e., before 1554</i>], she was not, in the best kind of learning,
inferior to those that all their life time had been brought up
in the Universities, and were counted jolly fellows.</p>

<p>And that you may understand that there hath not been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
nor is in her, learning only without nature, and knowledge
without towardness to practice; I will tell what hath been
heard of her first schoolmaster [<span class="smcap">John Aylmer</span>], a man very
honest and learned: who reported of her, to a friend of his, that
"He learned every day more of her, than she of him." Which
when it seemed to him a mystery, as indeed it was, and he
therefore desired to know his meaning therein, he thus
expounded it: "I teach her words," quoth he, "and she, me
things. I teach her the tongues to speak; and her modestly
and maidenly life teacheth me words to do. For," saith he,
"I think she is the best inclined and disposed of any in all
Europe."</p>

<p>It seemed to me a goodly commendation of her, and a
witty saying of him.</p>

<p>Likewise [<span class="smcap">Castiglione</span>] an Italian, which taught her his
tongue (although that nation lightly praise not out of their
own country), said once to the said party, that "He found in
her two qualities, which are never lightly yokefellows in one
woman; which were a singular wit, and a marvellous meek
stomach."</p>

<p>If time and leisure would serve to peruse her whole life
past, many other excellent and memorable examples of her
princely qualities and singular virtues might here be noted;
but none, in my mind, more worthy of commendation, or that
shall set forth the fame of her heroical and princely renown
more to all posterity, than the Christian patience, and incredible
clemency of her nature showed in her afflictions, and
towards her declared enemies. Such was then the wickedness
and rage of that time, wherein what dangers and
troubles were among the inferior subjects of this realm of
England, may be easily gathered when such a Princess, of
that Estate, being a King's daughter, a Queen's sister, and
Heir Apparent to the Crown, could not escape without her
cross.</p>

<p>And therefore, as we have hitherto discoursed [of] the afflictions
and persecutions of the other poor members of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
comprehended in this History before; so likewise, I see no
cause why the communion of Her Grace's afflictions also,
among the other saints of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, ought to be suppressed in
silence: especially seeing the great and marvellous workings of
GOD's glory, chiefly in this Story, appeareth above all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>And though I should, through ingratitude or silence, pass
over the same; yet the thing itself is so manifest, that what
Englishman is he which knoweth not the afflictions of Her
Grace to have been far above the condition of a King's
daughter: for there was no more behind, to make a very
<span class="smcap">Iphigenia</span> of her, but her offering up upon the altar of the
scaffold.</p>

<p>In which her storms and tempests, with what patience
Her Highness behaved herself, although it be best known to
them who, then being her adversaries, had the minding [<i>imprisoning</i>]
of her. Yet this will I say, by the way, that then
she must needs be in her affliction, marvellous patient: which
sheweth herself now, in this prosperity, to be utterly without
desire of revenge; or else she would have given some token,
ere this day, of remembrance, how she was handled.</p>

<p>It was no small injury that she suffered, in the Lord Protector's
days, by certain venomous vipers! But to let that
pass! was it no wrong, think you! or small injury that she
sustained, after the death of King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, when they sought
to defeat her and her sister from their natural inheritance
and right to the Crown?</p>

<p>But to let that pass likewise! and to come more near to
the late days of her sister, Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Into what fear,
what trouble of mind, and what danger of death was she
brought?</p>

<p>First, with great solemnity, with bands of harnessed men
[<i>i.e., in arms and armour</i>] (Happy was he that might have
the carrying of her!) to be fetched up, as the greatest traitor
in the world; clapped in the Tower: and, again, to be tossed
from thence, from prison to prison, from post to pillar. At
length, also prisoner in her own house; and guarded with a
sort [<i>number</i>] of cutthroats, which ever gaped for the spoil of
the same, that they might have been fingering of somewhat.</p>

<p>Which Story, if I should set forth at large, through all the
particulars and circumstances of the same, and as the just occasion
of the history requireth; peradventure, it would move
offence to some, being yet alive. Yet notwithstanding, I
intend, by the grace of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, therein to use such brevity
and moderation as may be to the glory of GOD, the discharge
of the Story, the profit of the reader, and hurt to none: suppressing
the names of some, whom here, although I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
recite, yet I thought not to be more cruel in hurting their
name, than the Queen hath been in pardoning their life.</p>

<p>Therefore, now to enter into the description of the matter.
First, to declare her undeserved troubles; and then, the
most happy deliverance out of the same, this is the Story.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary's</span> reign, mention
is made before, how the Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and the
Lord <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> were charged with false suspicion
of [being concerned in] Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Wyatt</span>'s
rising [<i>in January, 1554, see p.</i> 88].</p>

<p>Whereupon, Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, whether for that surmise, or for
what other cause I know not, being offended with the said Lady
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> her sister, at that time lying in her house at Ashridge
[<i>near Great Berkhampstead</i>], sent to her two Lords [<i>or</i>
<i>rather <span class="smcap">William</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Howard</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Hastings</span>,</i>
<i>afterwards Lord <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> of Loughborough; and Sir</i>
<i><span class="smcap">Thomas Cornwallis</span></i>, and Sir <span class="smcap">John Williams</span>, afterwards
Lord <span class="smcap">Williams</span>] of Thame, with their retinue, and
troop of horsemen, to the number of 250, who at their sudden
and unprovided [<i>unexpected</i>] coming <i>on the 11th February, 1554</i>,
found her at the same time, sore sick in bed, and very feeble
and weak of body.</p>

<p>Whither, when they came; ascending up to Her Grace's
Privy Chamber, willed there, one of her Ladies whom they
met, to declare unto Her Grace that "There were certain
Lords come from the Court, which had a message from the
Queen."</p>

<p>Her Grace having knowledge thereof, was right glad of
their coming: howbeit, being then very sick, and the night
far spent, which was at ten of the clock, requested them by
the messenger, that they would resort thither in the morning.</p>

<p>To this, they answered, and by the said messenger sent
word again, that "They must needs see her; and would do
so, in what case soever she were in." Whereat, the Lady
being aghast, went to shew Her Grace their words; but they
hastily following her, came rushing as soon as she, into Her
Grace's chamber, unbidden.</p>

<p>At whose so sudden coming into her bedchamber, Her
Grace being not a little amazed, said unto them, "My Lords!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
is the haste such, that it might not have pleased you to come
to-morrow, in the morning?"</p>

<p>They made answer, that "They were right sorry to see Her
Grace in that case."</p>

<p>"And I," quoth she, "am not glad to see you here, at this
time of the night!"</p>

<p>Whereunto, they answered that "They came from the
Queen to do their message and duty; which was to this
effect, that the Queen's pleasure was that she should be at
London, the 7th [? 12th] day of that present month."</p>

<p>Whereunto, she said, "My Lords! no creature [can be]
more glad than I, to come to Her Majesty; being right sorry
that I am not in case at this time, like to wait on her; as
you yourselves, my Lords! do see and can well testify!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, we see it true," quoth they, "that you do say;
for which we are very sorry: albeit we let you to understand
that our Commission is such, and so straineth us, that we
must needs bring you with us, either quick or dead."</p>

<p>Whereat she being amazed, sorrowfully said that "Their
commission was very sore! but yet, notwithstanding, she
hoped it to be otherwise, and not so straight."</p>

<p>"Yes, verily!" they answered.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Lords calling for two physicians, Doctor
<span class="smcap">Owen</span> and Doctor <span class="smcap">Wendif</span>, demanded of them, "Whether
she might be removed from thence, with life or not?" whose
answer and judgement was this, "That there was no impediment
to their judgement to the contrary; but that she might
travel without danger of life."</p>

<p>In conclusion, they willed her to prepare against the
morning, at nine of the clock, to go with them, declaring
that "they had brought with them, the Queen's litter for
her."</p>

<p>After much talk, the Lords declaring how there was no
prolonging of times and days, so departed to their chamber;
being entertained and cheered as appertained to their
Honours.</p>

<p>On the next morrow [<i>12th February</i>], at the time prescribed,
they had her forth as she was, very faint and feeble;
and in such case as she was ready to swoon three or four
times between them. What should I speak here that [which]
cannot well be expressed! What a heavy house there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to behold the unreverent and doleful dealing of the Lords;
but especially the careful fear and captivity of their innocent
Lady and mistress.</p>

<p>Now to proceed in their journey. From Ashridge, all sick
in the litter, she came to Redborne; where she was guarded
all night.</p>

<p>From thence, to St. Albans, to Sir <span class="smcap">Ralph Rowlet</span>'s
house; where she tarried that night all heavy, both feeble in
body, and comfortless in mind.</p>

<p>From that place, they passed to Master <span class="smcap">Dodd</span>'s house, at
Mimms [<i>near Potters' Bar</i>]; where they also remained that
night.</p>

<p>And so from thence, she came to Highgate: where she,
being very sick, tarried that night and the next day: during
which time of her abode, there came many pursuivants and
messengers from the Court unto the Lords; but what about,
I cannot tell.</p>

<p>From that place, she was conveyed to the Court; where
by the way came to meet her, many gentlemen to accompany
Her Highness, which were very sorry to see her in that case:
but especially a great multitude of people that were standing
by the way; who then flocking about her litter, lamented
and greatly bewailed her estate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now when she came to the Court, Her Grace was there
straightways shut up, and kept as close prisoner for a
fortnight, seeing neither Queen, nor Lord, nor friend at that
time; but only then, the Lord Chamberlain, Sir <span class="smcap">John Gage</span>,
and the Vice-Chamberlain, which were attendant upon the
doors.</p>

<p>About which time, Sir <span class="smcap">William St. Lo</span> was called before
the Council; to whose charge was laid, that he knew of
<span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>'s rebellion: which he stoutly denied, protesting that
he was a true man, both to God and his Prince, defying all
traitors and rebels. But being straitly examined, was, in
conclusion, committed to the Tower.</p>

<p>The Friday before Palm Sunday [<i>16th March</i>], [<span class="smcap">Stephen</span>
<span class="smcap">Gardiner</span>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, with nineteen others
of the Council (who shall be here nameless, as I have
promised) came unto Her Grace, from the Queen's Majesty;
and burdened [<i>accused</i>] her with <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>'s conspiracy: which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
she utterly denied, affirming that "she was altogether guiltless
therein."</p>

<p>They being not contented with this, charged Her Grace
with the business made by Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Carew</span> and the rest of
the Gentlemen of the West Country; which she also utterly
denying, cleared her innocency therein.</p>

<p>In conclusion, after long debating of matters, they declared
unto her, that "It was the Queen's will and pleasure that she
should go unto the Tower, while the matter were further
tried and examined."</p>

<p>Whereat, she being aghast, said that "She trusted the
Queen's Majesty would be a more gracious Lady unto her;
and that Her Highness would not otherwise conceive of her,
but that she was a true woman." Declaring furthermore to
the Lords, that "She was innocent in all those matters,
wherein they had burdened her, and desired them therefore
to be a further mean to the Queen her sister, that she, being
a true woman in thought, word, and deed, towards Her
Majesty, might not be committed to so notorious and doleful
a place": protesting that she would request no mercy at
her hand, if she should be proved to have consented unto
any such kind of matter as they laid unto her charge. And
therefore, in fine, desired their Lordships to think of her what
she was; and that she might not so extremely be dealt
withal for her truth.</p>

<p>Whereunto, the Lords answered that "There was no
remedy. For that the Queen's Majesty was fully determined
that she should go unto the Tower"; wherewith the Lords
departed, with their caps hanging over their eyes [<i>this was</i>
<i>a purposed sign of disrespect</i>].</p>

<p>But not long after, within the space of an hour or a little
more, came four of the foresaid Lords of the Council, with
the Guard, who warding the next chamber to her, secluded
all her Gentlemen and yeomen, Ladies and gentlewomen;
saving that for one Gentleman Usher, three Gentlewomen,
and two Grooms of her Chamber, were appointed in their
rooms, three other men, and three waiting women of the
Queen's, to give attendance upon her; that none should have
access to her Grace.</p>

<p>At which time, there were a hundred of Northern soldiers,
in white coats, watching and warding about the gardens all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
that night: a great fire being made in the midst of the Hall;
and two certain Lords watching there also with their Band
and company.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon Saturday, being Palm Sunday Eve [<i>17th March</i>], two
certain Lords of the Council, whose names here also we do
omit [<i>but who were the Marquis of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> and the Earl</i>
<i>of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span></i>], came and certified Her Grace that "forthwith
she must go unto the Tower! the barge being prepared for
her, and the tide now ready, which tarrieth for nobody."</p>

<p>In heavy mood, Her Grace requested the Lords, that "She
might tarry another tide;" trusting that the next would be
more joyous and better <i>because in the day time</i>.</p>

<p>But one of the Lords [<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>] replied that
"Neither tide nor time was to be delayed!"</p>

<p>And when Her Grace requested him, that she might be
suffered to write to the Queen's Majesty, he answered that
"He durst not permit that;" adding that, "in his judgement
it would rather hurt than profit Her Grace in so doing."</p>

<p>But the other Lord, who was the Earl of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, more
courteous and favourable, kneeling down, told Her Grace
that "She should have liberty to write, and, as he was a true
man, he would deliver it to the Queen's Highness; and
bring an answer of the same, whatsoever came thereof."</p>

<p>Whereupon she wrote: albeit she could not, nor might
not speak with her; to her great discomfort, being no offender
against Her Majesty.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If any ever did try this old saying, that <i>A King's word was more than</i>
<i>another man's oath</i>, I most humbly beseech your Majesty to verify it in
me; and to remember your last promise, and my last demand, that "I be
not condemned without answer and due proof," which it seems that I now
am: for, without cause proved, I am, by your Council, from you, commanded
to go to the Tower, a place more wonted for a false traitor than a
true subject, which, though I know I desire it not, yet, in the face of all
this realm, [it] appears proved. While I pray to GOD I may die the
shame-fullest death that ever any died afore, if I may mean any such thing!
and to this present hour I protest before GOD (who shall judge my truth,
whatsoever malice shall devise), that I never practised, counselled, nor
consented to anything that might be prejudicial to your person any way,
or dangerous to the State by any means. And therefore, I humbly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>seech
your Majesty to let me answer afore yourself and not suffer me to
trust to your Councillors; yea, and that afore I go to the Tower, if it be
possible, if not, before I be further condemned. Howbeit, I trust assuredly
your Highness will give me leave to do it, afore I go; that thus shamefully,
I may not be cried out on, as I now shall be: yea, and without cause!</p>

<p>Let conscience move your Highness to take some better way with me
than to make me be condemned in all men's sight afore my desert known!
Also I most humbly beseech your Highness to pardon this my boldness,
which innocency procures me to do; together with hope of your natural
kindness which I trust will not see me cast away, without desert: which
what it is, I would desire no more of GOD but that you truly knew; but
which thing, I think and believe you shall never by report know; unless
by yourself you hear.</p>

<p>I have heard of many, in my time, cast away for want of coming to
the presence of their Prince; and, in late days, I heard my Lord of
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span> say that "If his brother [<i>The Admiral Lord <span class="smcap">Thomas</span></i>
<i><span class="smcap">Seymour</span></i>] had been suffered to speak with him, he had never suffered;
but persuasions were made to him so great that he was brought in belief
that he could not live safely if the Admiral lived, and that made him give
consent to his death." Though these persons are not to be compared to
your Majesty; yet, I pray GOD, as evil persuasions persuade not one
sister against the other! and all for that they have heard false report, and
not hearken to the truth not known.</p>

<p>Therefore, once again, kneeling with humbleness of heart, because I
am not suffered to bow the knees of my body; I humbly crave to speak
with your Highness: which I would not be so bold as to desire, if I knew
not myself most clear, as I know myself most true.</p>

<p>And as for the traitor <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>, he might peradventure, write me a letter;
but, on my faith, I never received any from him. And as for the copy of
the letter sent to the French King, I pray GOD may confound me eternally
if ever I sent him word, message, token, or letter, by any means! And to
this truth, I will stand in to my death.</p>

<p>Your Highness's most faithful subject, that hath been from the beginning,
and will be to my end,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Elizabeth.</em></span>.<br />
</p>

<p>I humbly crave but only one word of answer from yourself.]</p></div>

<p>And thus the tide [<i>season</i>] and time passed away for that
time, till the next day, being Palm Sunday, when, about nine
of the clock, these two came again, declaring that "it was
time for Her Grace to depart."</p>

<p>She answered, "If there be no remedy, I must be contented;"
willing the Lords to go on before.</p>

<p>And being come forth into the garden, she did cast up her
eyes towards the window; thinking to have seen the Queen,
which she could not. Whereat she said, "She marvelled
much, what the Nobility of the realm meant; which, in that
sort, would suffer her to be led forth into captivity, the
LORD knew whither! for she did not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>After all this, she took her barge, with the two aforesaid
Lords, three of the Queen's Gentlewomen, and three of her own,
her Gentleman Usher, and two of her Grooms: lying and
hovering upon the water, an hour; for that they could not shoot
the Bridge [<i>the tide used to rush through the narrow spaces of</i>
<i>old London bridge, with the force of a mill-race</i>]: the bargemen
being very unwilling to shoot the same so soon as they did,
because of the danger thereof. For the stern of the boat
struck upon the ground, the fall was so big, and the water
was so shallow.</p>

<p>Then Her Grace desired of the Lords, that "She might
not land at the stairs where all traitors and offenders
customably used to land" [<i>called the Traitor's Gate</i>].</p>

<p>They answered that "it was past their remedy; for that
otherwise they had in commandment."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "if it be so, my Lords! I must needs
obey it: protesting before all your Honours, that here now
steppeth as true a subject as ever was, towards the Queen's
Highness. And before thee, O GOD! I speak it; having
none other friends, but only Thee!"</p>

<p>The Lords declared unto her that "there was no time then
to try the truth."</p>

<p>"You have said well, my Lords!" quoth she, "I am
sorry that I have troubled you!"</p>

<p>So then they passed on [<i>i.e., through the Traitor's Gate</i>], and
went into the Tower: where were a great company of harnessed
men, and armed soldiers warding on both sides:
whereat she being amazed, called the Lords to her, and
demanded "the cause, why those poor men stood there?"</p>

<p>They declared unto her, that "it was the use and order of
the place so to do."</p>

<p>"And if it be," quoth she, "for my cause; I beseech you
that they may be dismissed."</p>

<p>Whereat, the poor men kneeled down, and with one voice,
desired GOD to preserve Her Grace; who, the next day,
were released of their cold coats.</p>

<p>After this, passing a little further, she sat down upon a
cold stone, and there rested herself.</p>

<p>To whom, the Lieutenant [<i>Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span>, see p.</i> 78] then
being, said, "Madam, you were best to come out of the rain!
for you sit unwholesomely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>She then replying, answered again, "Better sitting here,
than in a worse place! For, GOD knoweth! I know not
whither you will bring me!"</p>

<p>With that, her Gentleman Usher wept. She demanded of
him, "What he meant so uncomfortably to use her, seeing
she took him to be her comforter, and not her dis-mayer:
especially for that she knew her truth to be such, that no
man should have cause to weep for her." But forth she
went into the prison.</p>

<p>The doors were locked and bolted upon her; which did
not a little discomfort and dismay Her Grace. At what
time, she called to her gentlewoman for her book [<i>i.e., her</i>
<i>Bible</i>], desiring GOD, "Not to suffer her to build her
foundation upon the sands, but upon the rocks! whereby all
blasts of blustering weather should have no power against
her."</p>

<p>After the doors were thus locked, and she close shut up;
the Lords had great conference how to keep ward and watch,
every man declaring his opinion in that behalf, agreeing
straightly and circumspectly to keep her: while that one of
them, I mean the Lord of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, swearing, said, "My
Lords! let us take heed! and do no more than our Commission
will bear us! whatsoever shall happen hereafter.
And, further, let us consider that she was the King our
Master's daughter! and therefore let us use such dealing,
that we may answer unto it hereafter, if it shall so happen!
For just dealing," said he, "is always answerable."</p>

<p>Whereunto the other Lords agreed that it was well said of
him: and thereupon departed.</p>

<p>It would make a pitiful and strange story, here by the way,
to touch and recite what examinations and rackings of poor
men there were, to find out the knife that should cut her
throat! what gaping among the Lords of the Clergy to see
the day, wherein they might wash their goodly white rochets
in her innocent blood? But especially the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester,</span>
<span class="smcap">Stephen Gardiner</span>, then Lord Chancellor, and
ruler of the rost.</p>

<p>Who then, within few days after [<i>March, 1554</i>], came unto
her, with divers other of the Council, and examined her of
the talk that was at Ashridge, betwixt her and Sir <span class="smcap">James</span>
<span class="smcap">a Croft</span> concerning her removing from thence to Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>nington
Castle, requiring her to declare, "What she meant
thereby?"</p>

<p>At the first, she, being so suddenly taken, did not well
remember any such house: but within a while, well advising
herself, she said, "Indeed, I do now remember that I have
such a place: but I never lay in it, in all my life. And as
for any that hath moved me thereunto, I do not remember."</p>

<p>Then to enforce the matter, they brought forth Sir <span class="smcap">James</span>
<span class="smcap">a Croft</span>.</p>

<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> demanded of her, "What she
said to that man?"</p>

<p>She answered that, "She had little to say to him, or to
the rest that were then prisoners in the Tower. But my
Lords!" quoth she, "you do examine every mean prisoner
of me! wherein, methinks, you do me great injury! If they
have done evil, and offended the Queen's Majesty, let them
answer to it accordingly. I beseech you, my Lords! join not
me in this sort with any of these offenders! And as concerning
my going unto Donnington Castle, I do remember
Master <span class="smcap">Hoby</span> and mine Officers, and you Sir <span class="smcap">James a Croft</span>!
had such talk: but what is that to the purpose, my Lords!
but that I may go to my own houses at all times?"</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, kneeling down, said, "Your Grace
saith true! and certainly we are very sorry that we have so
troubled you about so vain matters."</p>

<p>She then said, "My Lords, you did sift me very narrowly!
But well I am assured, you shall do no more to me, than
GOD hath appointed: and so, GOD forgive you all!"</p>

<p>At their departing, Sir <span class="smcap">James a Croft</span> kneeled down,
declaring that "He was sorry to see the day in which he
should be brought as a witness against Her Grace." "But,
I assure your Grace," said he, "I have been marvellously
tossed and examined touching your Highness; which, the
Lord knoweth! is strange to me. For I take GOD to
record! before all your Honours! I do not know anything
of that crime that you have laid to my charge! and will
thereupon take my death, if I should be driven to so straight
a trial."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[There seems no doubt that at the back of all the following efforts to alleviate
and terminate the imprisonment of the Princess, was the ever faithful
Sir <span class="smcap">William Cecil</span>, working by many secret means, as far as he dare.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>[Side note:
These were not
the Officers of
the Tower, but
such as went in
white and green.]</p>

<p>That day or thereabouts, divers of her own Officers, who
had made provision for her diet, brought the same to the
utter [<i>outer</i>] gate of the Tower; the common
rascal soldiers receiving it: which was no small
grief unto the Gentlemen, the bearers thereof.</p>

<p>Wherefore they required to speak with [Sir
<span class="smcap">John Gage</span>] the Lord Chamberlain, being then Constable of
the Tower: who, coming before his presence, declared unto
his Lordship that "they were much afraid to bring Her
Grace's diet, and to deliver it unto such common and
desperate persons as they were, which did receive it; beseeching
His Honour to consider Her Grace, and to give
such order that her viands might at all times be brought in
by them which were appointed thereunto."</p>

<p>"Yea, sirs!" said he, "who appointed you this office?"</p>

<p>They answer, "Her Grace's Council!"</p>

<p>"Council!" quoth he, "there is none of them which hath
to do, either in that case, or anything else within this place;
and, I assure you! for that she is a prisoner, she shall be
served with the Lieutenant's men, as the other prisoners are."</p>

<p>Whereat the Gentlemen said that "They trusted for more
favour at his hands! considering her personage," saying
that "They mistrusted not, but that the Queen and her
Council would be better to Her Grace than so!" and therewith
shewed themselves to be offended at the ungrateful
[<i>harsh</i>] words of the Lord Chamberlain, towards their Lady
and Mistress.</p>

<p>At this, he sware, by GOD! stroking himself on the breast;
that "If they did either frown or shrug at him; he would set
them where they should see neither sun nor moon!"</p>

<p>Thus taking their leave, they desired GOD to bring him
into a better mind towards Her Grace, and departed from him.</p>

<p>Upon the occasion whereof [<i>there being always a fear of</i>
<i>poisoned food</i>], Her Grace's Officers made great suit unto the
Queen's Council, that some might be appointed to bring her
diet unto her; and that it might no more be delivered in to
the common soldiers of the Tower: which being reasonably
considered, was by them granted. Thereupon were appointed
one of her Gentlemen, her Clerk of the Kitchen, and her two
Purveyors, to bring in her provisions once a day. All which
was done. The warders ever waiting upon the bringers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
thereof (and the Lord Chamberlain himself, being always
with them), circumspectly and narrowly watched and
searched what they brought; and gave heed that they should
have no talk with any of Her Grace's waiting servants; and
so warded them both in and out.</p>

<p>At the said suit of her Officers, were sent, by the commandment
of the Council, to wait upon Her Grace, two Yeomen
of her Chamber, one of her Robes, two of her Pantry and
Ewry, one of her Buttery, another of her Cellar, two of her
Kitchen, and one of her Larder: all which continued with
her, the time of her trouble.</p>

<p>Here the Constable (being at the first not very well pleased
with the coming in of such a company against his will) would
have had his men still to have served with Her Grace's men:
which her servants, at no hand, would suffer; desiring his
Lordship to be contented, for "that order was taken that no
stranger should come within their offices."</p>

<p>At which answer, being sore displeased, he brake out into
these threatening words: "Well," said he, "I will handle
you well enough!"</p>

<p>Then went he into the kitchen, and there would needs
have his meat roasted with Her Grace's meat; and said
"His cook should come thither, and dress it."</p>

<p>To that, Her Grace's Cook answered, "My Lord! I will
never suffer any stranger to come about her diet, but her
own sworn men, so long as I live!"</p>

<p>He said, "They should!"</p>

<p>But the Cook said, "His Lordship should pardon him for
that matter!"</p>

<p>Thus did he trouble her poor servants very stoutly: though
afterward he were otherwise advised, and they were more
courteously used at his hands. And good cause why! For
he had good cheer, and fared of the best; and Her Grace
paid well for it.</p>

<p>Wherefore he used himself afterwards more reverently
towards Her Grace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this sort, having lain a whole month there, in close
prison; and being very evil at ease therewithal; she sent
[<i>in April</i>] for the Lord Chamberlain and Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span>
[<i>see p.</i> 78] to come and speak with her.</p>

<p>Who coming, she requested them that "She might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
liberty to walk in some place, for that she felt herself not
well."</p>

<p>To the which, they answered that "They were right sorry
that they could not satisfy Her Grace's request; for that
they had commandment to the contrary, which they durst
not in any wise break."</p>

<p>Furthermore, she desired of them, "If that could not be
granted; that she might walk but into the 'Queen's Lodgings.'"</p>

<p>"No, nor that!" they answered, "could, by any means,
be obtained, without a further suit to the Queen and her
Council."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "my Lords! if the matter be so hard
that they must be sued unto, for so small a thing; and that
friendship be so strait, God comfort me!"</p>

<p>And so they departed: she remaining in her old dungeon
still; without any kind of comfort, but only GOD.</p>

<p>The next day after, the Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span> came again unto
Her Grace, declaring unto her that "He had sued unto the
Council for further liberty. Some of them consented thereunto.
Divers others dissented, for that there were so many
prisoners in the Tower. But in conclusion, they did all
agree that Her Grace might walk into those 'Lodgings';
so that he and the Lord Chamberlain, and three of the
Queen's Gentlewomen did accompany her: and the windows
were shut, and she not suffered to look out at any of them."
Wherewith, she contented herself; and gave him thanks for
his goodwill in that behalf.</p>

<p>Afterwards, there was liberty granted to Her Grace to walk
in a little garden, the doors and gates being shut up; which,
notwithstanding, was as much discomfort unto her, as the
walk in the garden was pleasant and acceptable. At which
times of her walking there, the prisoners on that side straightly
were commanded not to speak, or look out at the windows
into the garden, till Her Grace were gone out again: having
in consideration thereof, their keepers waiting upon them for
that time.</p>

<p>Thus Her Grace, with this small liberty, contented herself
in GOD, to whom be praise therefore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During this time, there used a little boy, the child of a
man in the Tower, to resort to their chambers, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
times to bring Her Grace flowers; which likewise he did to
the other prisoners that were there. Whereupon naughty
and suspicious heads thinking to make and wring out some
matter thereof, called, on a time, the child unto them, promising
him figs and apples, and asking, "When he had been
with the Earl of <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>?" not ignorant of the child's
wonted frequenting unto him.</p>

<p>The boy answered that "He would go by-and-by thither."</p>

<p>Further they demanded of him, "When he was with the
Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>?"</p>

<p>He answered, "Every day!"</p>

<p>Furthermore they examined him, "What the Lord <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>
sent by him to Her Grace?"</p>

<p>The child said, "I will go [and] know what he will give to
carry to her." Such was the discretion of the child, being
yet but three years of age.</p>

<p>"This same is a crafty boy!" quoth the Lord Chamberlain;
"what say you, my Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span>?"</p>

<p>"I pray you, my Lord! give me the figs ye promised me!"</p>

<p>"No, marry," quoth he, "thou shalt be whipped if thou
come any more to the Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, or the Lord
<span class="smcap">Courtney</span>!"</p>

<p>The boy answered, "I will bring the Lady, my Mistress,
more flowers!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the child's father was commanded to permit
the boy no more to come into their chambers.</p>

<p>And the next day, as Her Grace was walking in the garden,
the child, peeping in at a hole in the door, cried unto her,
saying, "Mistress! I can bring you no more flowers!"
Whereat, she smiled, but said nothing; understanding
thereby, what they had done.</p>

<p>Wherefore, afterwards, the Lord Chamberlain rebuked his
father highly; commanding him to put him out of the house.</p>

<p>"Alas, poor infant!" quoth the father.</p>

<p>"It is a crafty knave!" quoth the Lord Chamberlain.
"Let me see him here no more!"</p>

<p>The 5th day of May [1554], the Constable was discharged
of his office of the Tower; one Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> being
placed in his room. A man unknown to Her Grace, and
therefore the more feared: which so sudden [a] mutation
was unto her, no little amaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>He brought with him a hundred soldiers in blue coats;
wherewith she was marvellously discomforted; and demanded
of such as were about her, "Whether the Lady <span class="smcap">Jane</span>'s scaffold
were taken away or not?" fearing, by reason of their
coming, least she should have played her part.</p>

<p>To whom, answer was made, that "The scaffold was taken
away; and that Her Grace needed not to doubt [<i>fear</i>] any
such tyranny, for GOD would not suffer any such treason
against her person."</p>

<p>Wherewith, being contented, but not altogether satisfied,
she asked, "What Sir H. <span class="smcap">Bedingfield</span> was? and whether he
was of that conscience or not, that if her murdering were
secretly committed to his charge, he would see the execution
thereof?"</p>

<p>She was answered that "They were ignorant what manner
of man he was." Howbeit they persuaded her that GOD
would not suffer such wickedness to proceed.</p>

<p>"Well!" quoth she, "GOD grant it be so! For Thou! O
GOD! art the withdrawer and mollifier of all such tyrannous
hearts and acts! and I beseech Thee! to hear me thy
creature! which am Thy servant and at Thy commandment!
trusting by Thy grace ever so to remain."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About which time, it was spread abroad, that Her Grace
should be carried from thence; by this new jolly captain and
his soldiers; but whither, it could not be learned. Which
was unto Her Grace a great grief, especially for that such a
kind of company was appointed to her guard: requesting
rather to continue there still, than to be led thence with such
a rascal company.</p>

<p>At last, plain answer was made by the Lord <span class="smcap">Chandos</span>,
that "There was no remedy; but from thence she must needs
depart to the Manor of Woodstock, as he thought."</p>

<p>Being demanded of her, "For what cause?"</p>

<p>"For that," quoth he, "the Tower is like[ly] further to be
furnished."</p>

<p>Whereat she, being more greedy, as far as she durst, demanded,
"wherewith!"</p>

<p>He answered, "With such matter as the Queen and
Council were determined in that behalf: whereof he had no
knowledge." And so departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, the 16th day of May she was removed from
the Tower: the Lord Treasurer [<i>the Marquis of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span></i>]
being then there, for the lading of her carts, and discharging
the Place of the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>, being appointed her
goaler, did receive her with a company of rakehells to guard
her; besides the Lord of <span class="smcap">Derby's</span> Band [<i>servants</i>] wafting in
the country about, for the moonshine in the water[!]. Unto
whom, at length came, my Lord [<span class="smcap">Williams</span>] of Thame,
joined in Commission, with the said Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> for the safe
guiding of her to prison. And they together conveyed Her
Grace to Woodstock, as hereafter followeth.</p>

<p>The first day [<i>16th May</i>], they conducted her to Richmond,
where she continued all night: being restrained of her own
men, which were laid out in chambers; and Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>
<span class="smcap">Bedingfield</span> his soldiers appointed in their rooms, to give
attendance on her person.</p>

<p>Whereat she, being marvellously dismayed, thinking verily
some secret mischief a working towards her, called her Gentleman
Usher, and desired him with the rest of his company
to pray for her, "For this night," quoth she, "I think to die."</p>

<p>Whereat he being stricken to the heart, said, "GOD
forbid that any such wickedness should be pretended [<i>intended</i>]
against your Grace!"</p>

<p>So comforting her as well as he could, he at last burst out
in tears; and went from her down into the court where were
walking the Lord [<span class="smcap">Williams</span>] of Thame, and Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>
<span class="smcap">Bedingfield</span>; and he staying aside the Lord of Thame, who
had proffered to him much friendship, desire to speak with
him a word or two.</p>

<p>Unto whom, he familiarly said, "He should with all his
heart."</p>

<p>Which when Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> standing by, heard, he asked,
"What the matter was?"</p>

<p>To whom the Gentleman Usher answered, "No great
matter, sir, but to speak with my Lord a word or two!"</p>

<p>Then when the Lord of Thame came to him he spake in
this wise, "My Lord! you have always been my good Lord,
and so I beseech you to remain. Why I come to you at this
time, is to desire your Honour, unfeignedly to declare unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
me, whether any danger is meant unto my Mistress this night
or not? that I and my poor fellows may take such part as [it]
shall please GOD to appoint. For certainly we will rather
die, than she should secretly and innocently miscarry."</p>

<p>"Marry," said the Lord of Thame, "GOD forbid that
any such wicked purpose should be wrought! and rather than
it should be so, I, with my men, are ready to die at her feet also."</p>

<p>And so, GOD be praised! they passed that doubtful night,
with no little heaviness of heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day [<i>17th May</i>] passing over the water [<i>i.e., the</i>
<i>Thames</i>] at Richmond, going towards Windsor; Her Grace
espied certain of her poor servants standing on the other side,
which were very desirous to see her. Whom, when she
beheld, turning to one of her men standing by, said, "Yonder,
I see certain of my men; go to them! and say these words
from me, <i>Tanquam ovis!</i>"</p>

<p>So, she passing forward to Windsor, was lodged there that
night, in the Dean of Windsor's house: a place indeed more
meet for a priest, than a Princess.</p>

<p>And from thence [<i>on 18th May</i>] Her Grace was guarded and
brought the next night, to Master <span class="smcap">Dormer</span>'s house; where
much people standing by the way, some presented to her one
gift, and some another. So that Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> was greatly
moved thereat, and troubled the poor people very sore, for
shewing their loving hearts in such a manner; calling them
"Rebels!" and "Traitors!" with such like vile words.</p>

<p>Besides, as she passed through the villages, the townsmen
rang the bells, as being joyful of her coming; thinking verily
it had been otherwise than it was indeed: and as the sequel
proved after, to the poor men. For immediately the said
Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> hearing the same, sent his soldiers hither: who
apprehended some of the ringers, setting them in the stocks,
and otherwise uncourteously misused some others for their
good wills.</p>

<p>On the morrow [<i>18th May</i>] Her Grace passed from Master
<span class="smcap">Dormer</span>'s, where was, for the time of her abode, a straight
watch kept; came to the Lord of Thame his house [<i>at Thame</i>]
where she lay all the next night; being very princely entertained,
both of Knights and Ladies, gentlemen and gentlewomen.
Whereat Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> gronted [<i>grunted</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and was highly offended, saying unto them that "They could
not tell what they did, and were not able to answer to their
doings in that behalf; letting them to understand that she
was the Queen's Majesty's prisoner, and no otherwise; advising
them therefore to take heed, and beware of after claps!"</p>

<p>Whereunto, the Lord of Thame answered him in this wise,
that "He was well advised of [<i>in</i>] his doings, being joined in
Commission as well as he," adding with warrant, that "Her
Grace might, and should, in his house, be merry."</p>

<p>After this, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> went up into a chamber, where were
appointed for Her Grace, a chair, two cushions, and a foot-carpet,
very fair and prince-like; wherein presumptuously he
sat, calling for <span class="smcap">Barwick</span>, his man, to pull off his boots: which
as soon as it was known among the ladies and gentles, every
one musing thereat, did laugh him to scorn; and observed his
indiscreet manners in that behalf, as they might very well.</p>

<p>When supper was done, he called my Lord, and willed him
that all the Gentlemen and Ladies should withdraw themselves;
every one to his lodging: marvelling much that he
would permit there such a company; considering so great a
charge was committed to him.</p>

<p>"Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>!" quoth my Lord, "content yourself! All
shall be voided, your men and all."</p>

<p>"Nay, my soldiers," quoth Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, "shall watch all
night."</p>

<p>The said Lord of Thame answered, "It shall not need."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "need or need not, they shall do so,"
mistrusting, belike, the company; which, GOD knoweth, was
without cause.</p>

<p>The next day [<i>19th May</i>] Her Grace took her journey from
thence, to Woodstock; where she was enclosed, as before
in the Tower of London; the soldiers guarding and warding
both within and without the walls, every day to the number
of three score, and, in the night, without the walls forty;
during the time of her imprisonment there.</p>

<p>At length, she had gardens appointed for her walks, which
were very comfortable to Her Grace. Always when she did
recreate herself therein, the doors were fast locked up, in as
straight a manner as they were in the Tower; there being at
the least five or six locks between her lodging and her walks;
Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> himself keeping the keys, trusted no man therewith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon she called him "her gaoler:" and he, kneeling
down, desired Her Grace not to call him so, for he was
appointed there to be one of her Officers.</p>

<p>"From such Officers," quoth she, "good Lord, deliver me!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, by way of digression, or rather of refreshing the
reader (if it be lawful in so serious a story to recite a matter
incident, and yet not impertinent to the same) occasion
here moveth or rather enforceth me to touch briefly what
happened in the same place and time, by a certain merry conceited
man, being then about Her Grace. Who (noting the
straight and strange keeping of his Lady and Mistress by the
said Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>, with so many locks and doors,
with such watch and ward about her, as was strange and
wonderful) spied a goat in the ward where Her Grace was;
and (whether to refresh her oppressed mind, or to notify her
straight handling by Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>; or else both), he took it up
on his neck, and followed Her Grace therewith, as she was
going to her lodging. Who, when she saw it, asked him,
"What he would do with him?" willing him to let it alone.</p>

<p>Unto whom, the said party answered, "No, by Saint
Mary! if it like your Grace! will I not! For I cannot tell
whether he be one of the Queen's friends or not. I will, GOD
willing! carry him to Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>, to know what
he is."</p>

<p>So, leaving Her Grace, went, with the goat on his neck,
and carried it to Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>; who, when he saw
him coming with it, asked him half angrily, "What he had
there?"</p>

<p>Unto whom the party answered, saying, "Sir! I cannot
tell what he is. I pray you, examine him! for I found him
in the place where my Lady's Grace was walking, and what
talk they have had, I cannot tell. For I understand him not,
but he should seem to me to be some stranger: and I think
verily a Welshman, for he hath a white frieze coat on his
back. And forasmuch as I being the Queen's subject, and
perceiving the strait charge committed to you of her keeping,
that no stranger should have access to her, without sufficient
license: I have here found a stranger (what he is, I cannot
tell) in the place where Her Grace was walking; and, therefore,
for the necessary discharge of my duty, I thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
good to bring the said stranger to you to examine, as you see
cause." And so he set him down.</p>

<p>At which his words, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> seemed much
displeased, and said, "Well! well! you will never leave this
gear, I see." And so they departed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now to return to the matter from whence we have digressed.</p>

<p>After Her Grace's being there a time [<i>i.e., about a year</i>],
she made suit to the Council, that she might be suffered to
write to the Queen; which, at last, was permitted to Her
Grace. So that Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> brought her pen,
ink, and paper; and standing by her, while she wrote, which
he very straitly observed; always, she being weary, would
carry away her letters, and bring them again when she called
for them.</p>

<p>In the finishing thereof, he would have been messenger to
the Queen of the same; whose request Her Grace denied,
saying, "One of her own men should carry them; and that
she would neither trust him, nor none of his thereabouts."</p>

<p>Then he answering again, said, "None of them durst be so
bold," he trowed, "to carry her letters, being in her present
case!"</p>

<p>"Yes," quoth she, "I am assured I have none so dishonest
that would deny my request in that behalf; but will be as
willing to serve me now as before."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "my Commission is to the contrary; and
may not suffer it."</p>

<p>Her Grace, replying again, said, "You charge me very
often with your Commission! I pray GOD you may justly
answer the cruel dealing ye deal with me!"</p>

<p>Then he kneeling down, desired Her Grace to think and
consider how he was a servant, and put in trust there by the
Queen to serve Her Majesty: protesting that if the case were
hers, he would as willingly serve Her Grace, as now he did
the Queen's Highness.</p>

<p>For the which answer, Her Grace thanked him, desiring
GOD that she might never have need of such servants as he
was: declaring further to him that his doings towards her
were not good or answerable, but more than all the friends
he had, would stand by; for in the end, she plainly told him,
they would forsake him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>To whom, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> replied, and said that "There was
no remedy but his doings must be answered; and so they
should, trusting to make a good account thereof."</p>

<p>The cause which moved Her Grace so to say, was for that
he would not permit her letters to be carried, four or five days
after the writing thereof. But, in fine, he was content to send
for her Gentleman from the town of Woodstock, demanding
of him, "Whether he durst enterprise the carriage of Her
Grace's letters to the Queen or not?"</p>

<p>And he answered, "Yea, sir! That I dare, and will, with all
my heart."</p>

<p>Whereupon, Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, half against his stomach, took
them to him, to the effect aforesaid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, about the 8th of June [1555] came down Doctor
<span class="smcap">Owen</span> and Doctor <span class="smcap">Wendif</span>, sent by the Queen to Her Grace,
for that she was sickly; who ministering to her, and letting
her blood, tarried there, and attended on Her Grace five or six
days: who being well amended, they returned again to the
Court, making their good report to the Queen and Council,
of Her Grace's behaviour and humbleness towards the Queen's
Highness; which Her Majesty hearing, took very thankfully.
But the Bishops thereat repined, looked black in the mouth,
and told the Queen, they "marvelled she submitted not herself
to Her Majesty's mercy, considering that she had offended
Her Highness."</p>

<p>Wily champions, ye may be sure! and friends at a need!
GOD amend them!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About this time, Her Grace was requested by a secret friend,
"to submit herself to the Queen's Majesty; which would be
very well taken, and to her great quiet and commodity."</p>

<p>Unto whom, she answered that "She would never submit
herself to them whom she had never offended! For," quoth
she, "if I have offended, and am guilty; I then crave no mercy,
but the law! which I am certain I should have had, ere this,
if it could be proved by me. For I know myself, I thank
GOD! to be out of the danger thereof, wishing that I were
as clear out of the peril of my enemy; and then I am sure I
should not be so locked and bolted up within walls and doors as
I am. GOD give them a better mind! when it pleaseth Him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time [<i>i.e., after the Queen's marriage on 3rd July</i>
<i>1555</i>] was there a great consulting among the Bishops and
gentlemen, touching a marriage for Her Grace: which some
of the Spaniards wished to be with some stranger, that she
might go out of the realm with her portion. Some saying
one thing, and some another.</p>

<p>A Lord [<i>Lord <span class="smcap">Paget</span></i>] being there, at last said that "the
King should never have any quiet common wealth in England;
unless her head were stricken from the shoulders."</p>

<p>Whereunto the Spaniards answered, saying, "GOD forbid
that their King and Master should have that mind to consent
to such a mischief!" This was the courteous answer of the
Spaniards to the Englishmen speaking, after that sort, against
their own country.</p>

<p>From that day, the Spaniards never left off their good persuasions
to the King, that the like honour he should never
obtain as he should in delivering the Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>'s
Grace out of prison: whereby, at length, she was happily
released from the same.</p>

<p>Here is a plain and evident example of the good nature and
clemency of the King and his Councillors towards Her Grace.
Praised be GOD therefore! who moved their hearts therein.</p>

<p>Then hereupon, she was sent for, shortly after, to come to
Hampton Court.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In her imprisonment at Woodstock, these verses she wrote
with her diamond, in a glass window.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Much suspected by me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Nothing proved can be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Quoth <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> the prisoner.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In the Second Edition of his <i>Actes</i>,&amp;c., published in 1570 under the fresh
title of <i>Ecclesiastical History, p. 2,294</i>; <span class="smcap">John Fox</span> gives the following
additional information of the Woodstock imprisonment.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And thus much touching the troubles of Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
at Woodstock.</p>

<p>Whereunto this is more to be added, that during the same
time the Lord [<span class="smcap">Williams</span>] of Thame had laboured for the
Queen, and became surety for her, to have her from Woodstock
to his house, and had obtained grant thereof. But
(through the procurement either of Master <span class="smcap">Bedingfield</span>, or
by the doing of [the Bishop of] <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, her mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
enemy), letters came over night, to the contrary: whereby
her journey was stopped.</p>

<p>Thus, this worthy Lady, oppressed with continual sorrow,
could not be permitted to have recourse to any friends she
had; but still in the hands of her enemies, was left desolate,
and utterly destitute of all that might refresh a doleful heart,
fraught full of terror and thraldom. Whereupon no marvel,
if she hearing, upon a time, out of her garden at Woodstock,
a certain milkmaid singing pleasantly, wished herself to be a
milkmaid, as she was: saying that "Her case was better, and
life more merry than hers, in that state she was."]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> and his soldiers, with the Lord
[<span class="smcap">Williams</span>] of Thame, and Sir <span class="smcap">Ralph Chamberlain</span> guarding
and waiting upon her, the first night [<i>July 1555</i>] from
Woodstock, she came to Rycot.</p>

<p>The next night to Master <span class="smcap">Dormer</span>'s; and so to Colebrook,
where she lay all that night at the <i>George</i>. By the
way, coming to the said Colebrook, certain of her gentlemen
and yeomen, to the number of three score met Her
Grace, much to all their comforts: which had not seen Her
Grace of long season before, neither could: but were commanded,
in the Queen's name, "immediately to depart the
town," to Her Grace's no little heaviness and theirs, who
could not be suffered once to speak with from them. So
that night all her men were taken her, saving her Gentleman
Usher, three gentlewomen, two Grooms, and one of her
Wardrobe; the Soldiers watching and warding round-about
the house, and she shut up close within her prison.</p>

<p>The next day Her Grace entered Hampton Court on the
back side, unto the Prince's Lodgings. The doors being shut
to her; and she, guarded with soldiers as before, lay there a
fortnight at the least, ere ever any had recourse unto her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At length, came the Lord <span class="smcap">William Howard</span>, who marvellously
honourably used Her Grace: whereat she took
much comfort, and requested him to be a means that she
might speak with some of the Council.</p>

<p>To whom, not long after came the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>,
the Lord of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, the Lord of <span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span>, and Secretary
<span class="smcap">Petre</span>; who, with great humility, humbled themselves
to Her Grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>She again likewise saluting them, said, "My Lords! I am
glad to see you! For, methinks, I have been kept a great
while from you, desolately alone. Wherefore I would desire
you to be a means to the King's and Queen's Majesties, that
I may be delivered from prison, wherein I have been kept a
long space, as to you, my Lords, is not unknown!"</p>

<p>When she had spoken, <span class="smcap">Stephen Gardiner</span>, the Bishop of
<span class="smcap">Winchester</span> kneeled down, and requested that "She would
submit herself to the Queen's Grace; and in so doing he had
no doubt but that Her Majesty would be good unto her."</p>

<p>She made answer that "rather than she would do so, she
would lie in prison all the days of her life:" adding that
"she craved no mercy at Her Majesty's hand, but rather
desired the law, if ever she did offend her Majesty in thought,
word, or deed. And besides this, in yielding," quoth she,
"I should speak against myself, and confess myself to be an
offender, which I never was towards Her Majesty; by occasion
whereof, the King and Queen, might ever hereafter conceive
an ill opinion of me: and, therefore, I say, my Lords! it
were better for me to lie in prison for the truth, than to be
abroad and suspected of my Prince."</p>

<p>And so they departed, promising to declare her message to
the Queen.</p>

<p>On the next day [<i>July 1555</i>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>
came again unto Her Grace, and kneeling down, declared that
"The Queen marvelled that she should so stoutly use herself,
not confessing to have offended; so that it should seem the
Queen's Majesty wrongfully to have imprisoned Her Grace."</p>

<p>"Nay," quoth my Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, "it may please her
to punish me, as she thinketh good."</p>

<p>"Well," quoth <span class="smcap">Gardiner</span>, "Her Majesty willeth me to
tell you, that you must tell another tale ere that you be set
at liberty."</p>

<p>Her Grace answered that "She had as lief be in prison
with honesty and truth, as to be abroad suspected of Her
Majesty. And this that I have said, I will stand to. For I
will never belie myself!"</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> again kneeled down, and said,
"Then your Grace hath the vantage of me and the other
Lords, for your long and wrong imprisonment."</p>

<p>"What vantage I have," quoth she, "you know; taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
GOD to record, I seek no vantage at your hands, for your so
dealing with me. But GOD forgive you, and me also!"</p>

<p>With that, the rest kneeled, desiring Her Grace that "all
might be forgotten," and so departed, she being fast locked
up again.</p>

<p>A sevennight after [<i>July 1555</i>], the Queen's Majesty sent
for Her Grace, at ten of the clock in the night, to speak with
her. For she had not seen her in two years before. Yet for
all that, she was amazed at the so sudden sending for,
thinking it had been worse for her, than afterwards proved;
and desired her gentlemen and gentlewomen to "pray for her!
for that she could not tell whether ever she should see them
again or not."</p>

<p>At which time, coming in with Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span> and
Mistress <span class="smcap">Clarencius</span> [<i>p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a></i>], Her Grace was brought into
the garden, unto a stairs' foot, that went into the Queen's
Lodging; Her Grace's gentlewomen waiting upon her, her
Gentleman Usher and his grooms going before with torches.
Where her gentlemen and gentlewomen being all commanded
to stay, saving one woman; Mistress <span class="smcap">Clarencius</span> conducted
her to the Queen's bedchamber, where Her Majesty was.</p>

<p>At the sight of whom, Her Grace kneeled down, and
desired GOD to "preserve Her Majesty! not mistrusting, but
that she should try herself as true a subject towards Her
Majesty as ever any did," and desired Her Majesty even so
to judge of her; and said "she should not find her to the
contrary; whatsoever false report otherwise had gone of her."</p>

<p>To whom, the Queen answered, "You will not confess
your offence; but stand stoutly in your truth! I pray GOD!
it may so fall out."</p>

<p>"If it do not," quoth she, "I request neither favour nor
pardon at your Majesty's hands."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Queen, "you stiffly still persevere in
your truth! Belike, you will not confess but that you have
wrongly punished!"</p>

<p>"I must not say so, if it please your Majesty! to you!"</p>

<p>"Why, then," said the Queen, "belike you will to others."</p>

<p>"No, if it please your Majesty!" quoth she, "I have
borne the burden, and must bear it. I humbly beseech your
Majesty to have a good opinion of me, and to think me to be
your true subject; not only from the beginning, hitherto; but
for ever, as long as life lasteth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they departed [<i>separated</i>], with very few comfortable
words of the Queen in English. But what she said in
Spanish, GOD knoweth! It is thought that King <span class="smcap">Philip</span>
was there, behind a cloth [<i>tapestry</i>], and not shewn; and that
he shewed himself a very friend in that matter, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus Her Grace departing, went to her lodging again; and
the sevennight after, was released of Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>,
"her gaoler," as she termed him, and his soldiers.</p>

<p>So Her Grace, set at liberty from imprisonment, went into
the country, and had appointed to go with her, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>
<span class="smcap">Pope</span>, one of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s Councillors; and one of her
Gentleman Ushers, Master <span class="smcap">Gage</span>; and thus straitly was she
looked to, all Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s time.</p>

<p>And this is the discourse of Her Highness's imprisonment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then there came to Lamheyre, Master <span class="smcap">Jerningham</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Norris</span>, Gentleman Usher, Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s men; who took
away from Her Grace, Mistress <span class="smcap">Asheley</span> to the Fleet, and
three others of her gentlemen to the Tower; which thing was
no little trouble to Her Grace, saying, that "she thought
they would fetch all away at the end." But God be praised!
shortly after was fetched away <span class="smcap">Gardiner</span>, through the merciful
providence of the LORD's goodness, by occasion of whose
opportune decease [<i>13th November, 1555</i>] the life of this so excellent
Prince that is the wealth of England, was preserved.</p>

<p>After the death of this <span class="smcap">Gardiner</span>; followed the death also,
and dropping away of others, her enemies; whereby, by little
and little, her jeopardy decreased, fear diminished, hope of
more comfort began to appear, as out of a dark cloud; and
though as yet Her Grace had no full assurance of perfect
safety, yet more gentle entertainment daily did grow unto
her, till the same day, which took away the said Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>,
brought in the same her foresaid sister, Lady <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> in
to the right of the Crown of England. Who, after so long
restrainment, so great dangers escaped, such blusterous
storms overblown, so many injuries digested and wrongs
sustained: the mighty protection of our merciful GOD, to
our no little safeguard, hath exalted and erected, out of thrall,
to liberty; out of danger, to peace and rule; from dread, to
dignity; from misery, to majesty; from mourning, to ruling;
briefly, of a prisoner, hath made her a Prince; and hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
placed her in her royal throne, being placed and proclaimed
Queen with as many glad hearts of her subjects, as ever was
any King or Queen in this realm before, or ever shall be (I
think) hereafter.</p>

<p>In whose advancement, and this her princely governance,
it cannot sufficiently be expressed what felicity and blessed
happiness this realm hath received, in receiving her at the
LORD's almighty and gracious hand. For as there have
been divers Kings and Rulers over this realm, and I have
read of some; yet could I never find in English Chronicles,
the like that may be written of this our noble and worthy
Queen, whose coming in was not only so calm, so joyful, so
peaceable, without shedding of any blood; but also her
reigning hitherto (reign now four years and more) hath been
so quiet, that yet (the LORD have all the glory!) to this
present day, her Sword is a virgin, spotted and polluted with
no drop of blood.</p>

<p>In speaking whereof, I take not upon me the part of the
Moral, or of the Divine Philosopher, to Judge of things done;
but only keep me within the compass of an Historiographer,
declaring what hath been before; and comparing things done,
with things now present, the like whereof, as I said, is not to
be found lightly in Chronicles before. And this, as I speak
truly, so would I to be taken without flattery; to be left to our
posterity, <i>ad sempiternam clementi&aelig; illius memoriam</i>.</p>

<p>In commendation of which her clemency, I might also here
add, how mildly Her Grace, after she was advanced to her
Kingdom, did forgive the said Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bedingfield</span>;
suffering him, without molestation, to enjoy goods, life, lands,
and liberty. But I let this pass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus hast thou, gentle Reader! simply but truly described
unto thee, the time, first, of the sorrowful adversity of this
our most Sovereign Queen that now is; also, the miraculous
preserving her in so many straights and distresses: which I
thought here briefly to notify, the rather for that the wondrous
works of the LORD ought not to be suppressed; and
that also Her Majesty, and we her poor subjects likewise,
having thereby a present matter always before our eyes, be
admonished how much we are bound to His Divine majesty,
and also to render thanks to Him condignly for the same.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> may please your goodness, Honourable Lord! to
receive in good part, the little labour of my pen:
which, albeit the rudeness and quantity thereof
procureth not to be dedicate[d] to so honourable a
Personage; yet the matter itself is of such worthiness, as
duly deserveth to be graven in gold. But who goeth about so
finely to depict with <span class="smcap">Apelles</span>'s instrument, this said <i>Register</i>,
thinking to exceed the rest? Not I! poor wretch! because
I am assured that such a worthy work as thereof may be
written, cannot, neither shall pass untouched among so
many godly learned. But were it, that no man hereafter
should, in more ample and learned manner, set forth the
same; yet should my presumption (if I so meant) be turned
to reproach: for this I believe, that they be in such sort
registered in the Book of the Living, as passeth either pen,
ink, or memory to declare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>This my simplicity and too bold attempt might move your
Honour to conjecture in me much rudeness, or, at the least,
might persuade me so to think: but that experience hath
showed me the humility and gentleness of your long tried
patience; the certain knowledge whereof hath pricked me forward
in this my pretence. And being thereunto requested of
a faithful brother and friend; I have, with more industry than
learning, GOD knoweth! finished the same.</p>

<p>Which being, as I thought, brought to good end; I
desired, according to the accustomed manner, to dedicate
the same unto such [an] one, as would not contemn so
simple a gift. And calling you to mind, Right Honourable
Lord! I knew none more meet. First, because your knowledge
in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> teacheth you the same godly and virtuous
life; which not only your Lordship, but all other Honourable,
&amp;c., ought to ensue. Secondly, because these late years, you
have had good experience of the troubles and miseries of the
faithful, which have patiently embraced in their arms, the
comfortable, although painful, cross of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; which, in so
great a number, is commonly not so plenteous as commendable.
But what stand I praising this patience in them
(which yet deserveth the same)? seeing the mighty GOD
and His <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath prepared, from everlasting, for such,
a glorious, rich and incomprehensible Crown of Felicity and
continual comforts.</p>

<p>This my short and simple work, I commend and dedicate
unto your Lordship! craving pardon at your hands, for this
my too homely and rude enterprise: considering that albeit
golden fruit were offered in pewter and by the hands of a
simple man; yet is the fruit notwithstanding still precious,
and neither abased by the pewter, nor the giver. Even so,
Honourable Lord! though the verses be simple, and the
giver unworthy: yet the fruit or matter is precious, comfortable
and good.</p>

<p>The order to attain to the perfect understanding of my
mind, in setting forth the same with figures and letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
shall largely appear in this book: which I have not only done
to make plain unto your Honour, the year, month, and day;
but also, to all others that hereafter shall read it. For that
I do pretend [<i>design</i>], if GOD and favour will permit it, to
use the same as common to the profit of all: for which cause,
I have also placed a Preface to the Reader.</p>

<p>But that it may please your Honour, in respect of the premises,
to extend your favourable assistance to the manifest
setting forth of this short and simple work, to the glory of the
great and mighty GOD, and to the comfort of Christians: I,
as unworthy and too bold a suitor, most humbly craveth your
Lordship's aid and supportation in the same; especially to
bear [with] the rudeness of my unlearned style, which, alas, I
lament.</p>

<p>But now ceasing to trouble your Lordship any longer, this
shall be my continual prayer for you.</p>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">May</span> it please thee, gentle Reader, to take in good
worth this short and simple <i>Register</i>, containing
the names of divers, although not all, both men,
women, and virgins, &amp;c., who, for the profession
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> their Captain, have been most
miserably afflicted, tormented, and [im]prisoned; and, in fine,
either died by some occasion in prison, or else erected [<i>gone</i>
<i>to heaven</i>] in the charret [<i>fiery chariot</i>] of <span class="smcap">Elias</span>, since the 4th
day of February, 1555, to the 17th day of November, 1558,
wherein (according to the determination of our most merciful
Father) our long wished for and most noble Queen, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
was placed Governess and Queen, by general Proclamation;
to the great comfort of all true English hearts.</p>

<p>This I commit to thy friendly acceptation and favourable
scanning, gentle Reader, and albeit, I doubt not but some,
of godly zeal, both wise and learned, will not neglect, hereafter,
to set forth so worthy a work, namely, of the martyrdom
and patient sufferings of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s elect Members; and also of
the tyrannical tragedies of the unmerciful Ministers of <span class="smcap">Satan</span>:
yet, at the request of a dear friend, to whom love and Nature
hath linked me, I could not, without ingratitude, deny his
lawful desire, attempting the same; also, rather because it
might be manifest to the eyes of the world, and also put the
learned, of godly zeal, in memory more amply to enlarge;
and, at their good discretion, to set forth the same. Pardon
my rudeness, therefore, I beseech thee! considering that
will in the unable is to be esteemed. Look not upon the
baseness of the metre! the true number whereof cannot
easily be observed in such a gathering of names: but, with
lifted eyes of the mind, meditate upon the omnipotent power of
GOD! which hath given and wrought such constancy in His
children, in these our days, that even in fiery flambes [<i>flames</i>]
and terrible torments, they have not ceased to invocate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
extol the name of their Creator, Redeemer, and Comforter,
according to the saying of the cxlviii. <i>Psalm</i>, "Young men
and maidens, old men and children" have set forth His
worthy and excellent praise. So that the same just and
righteous GOD, who, for our sins, corrected us, and gave us
over into the hands of the most bloody and viperous generation,
to be eaten like bread: hath now, of His mercy alone,
"exalted the horn of His people." Therefore all His saints
shall praise Him.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap"><i>In primus</i></span>, the figures, which are always four in
number, are placed in the middle of the two
strykes [<i>strokes, or rules</i>], which go between the
verses, within two short strikes; signify the year
wherein those persons were slain under them
contained.</p>

<p>And where you see a little cross, &#x2720;, on the outside of the
outmost line, it signifieth the changing of the year [<i>i.e., on</i>
<i>the 25th March</i>], as from 1554 to 1555; and in such manner.</p>

<p>The letters which stand in the little square place, on the
right side of the book, signified the month wherein they died;
and for the plainer understanding thereof I have used twelve
letters, for the twelve months: that is, A, for January; B, for
February; C, for March; D, for April; E, for May; F, for
June; G, for July; H, for August; I, for September; K, for
October; L, for November; M, for December.</p>

<p>But where one letter standeth in the little square place;
and another is placed under it between the two lines before
the verse be ended; it signified the changing of the month:
so that the person or persons, where against the letter so
changed doth stand, was put to death in that month which
that letter doth signify.</p>

<p>And whereas, in the third Verse [<i>or Stanza, p</i>. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>], and nowhere
else, there standeth figures on the right side, between
the two lines; that giveth to understand that <span class="smcap">Hunter</span>,
<span class="smcap">Higbye</span>, <span class="smcap">Picket</span>, and <span class="smcap">Knight</span>, which are placed in one line,
were burnt at three sundry days.</p>

<p>The figures which standeth in the little square place, on
the left side of the book, is but the sum of the Verses. But
those which stand between the two lines on the left side of
the book, signified the day of the month, wherein that
person or persons died, where against those figures stand.</p>

<p>The figures, which stand without both the lines, on the top
of the right side, signifieth the folio or number of the sides;
but the figures which stand underneath the nether strike,
between the two lines, is the number of persons murdered on
that side [<i>i.e., of the page</i>].</p>

<p>This is done, gentle Reader! that thou shouldest understand
the year, month, and day wherein every person died;
according to the knowledge that I have learned.</p>

<p>Also, in some places, where you shall see a name or names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stand without figures; that signifieth the certain day to be
unknown. Some, therefore, perchance, will judge much
rashness in me to write with ignorance; to whom, with
reverence, I answer, that as I received the names registered
and gathered by a good gentleman: even so, at a friend's
desire, I have put them in metre, in this little book, thinking
that, by pleasantness of reading, and easiness [<i>cheapness</i>] of
price, they might be the more largely blown and known.</p>

<p>For my desire is that all men should participate [in] this
my travail: and were the author and inditing half so
worthy as the matter; then would I most earnestly wish and
desire that it might be conveyed and delivered to the Queen's
Majesty's own hands. Wherein Her Grace might see, what
unmerciful Ministers had charge over the poor sheep; who,
wolfishly, at their wills, devoured the same: and, also, what
ruin and decay of Her Grace's subjects (that might have
been), they have brought to pass. Therein might Her Grace
see, as in a glass, how that bloodthirsty generation, neither
spared hore [<i>hoary</i>] headed and ancient age, which all men
ought to honour; neither youth, nor middle age; neither
wife, nor widow; young man, nor tender virgin. But like
the unnatural eggs of <span class="smcap">Astyages</span> that tyrant, destroy, and
spill the blood of all: besides stocking [<i>putting in the stocks</i>],
racking [<i>putting on the rack</i>], and whipping of the younger
sort; whom shame would not suffer to kill, as some are well
enough known, and I am not altogether ignorant [of].</p>

<p>Should such tyrannical tragedies be kept one hour, from
the hands of so noble and virtuous a Governess? whose
princely and natural heart, I doubt not, should have occasion
thereby to be, in both kinds, both heavy and joyful: heavy,
for the innocent blood spilt; but joyful for the praises of her
GOD, and that our GOD shall be honoured thereby, while
the world doth endure. I doubt whether [<i>doubt not but</i>] Her
Grace, inwardly wrapt up with <span class="smcap">Paul</span> and <span class="smcap">John</span> in divine science,
will brast [<i>burst</i>] out and say, "O happy <span class="smcap">Latimer!</span> <span class="smcap">Cranmer!</span>
<span class="smcap">Hooper!</span> <span class="smcap">Rogers!</span> <span class="smcap">Farrer!</span> <span class="smcap">Taylor!</span> <span class="smcap">Saunders!</span>
<span class="smcap">Philpot!</span> <span class="smcap">Cardmaker!</span> <span class="smcap">Bradford!</span> &amp;c.; you members of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>! you faithful Fathers and preaching Pastors! you,
that have not defiled yourselves with abomination, but have
washed your garments white in the blood of the Lamb! you,
that in fiery torments, with <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, have called upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
name of your Redeemer, and so finished you lives! you that
are now clothed in white garments of innocency, with crowns
of consolation, and palms of victory in your hands, following
the Lamb withersoever He goeth!" Or else, in anguish
of soul, sighingly to say, "O thou tyrannous and unmerciful
world! thou monstrous and unnatural generation! what
devil inflamed thy mind such malicious mischief? to torment
and shed the blood of such innocent livers, perfect
preachers and worthy counsellors, learned ministers, diligent
divines, perfect personages, and faithful shepherds. They
were constant Confessors before, but thou (with the Roman
Emperor) thoughtest to prevent the determination of GOD,
in making them Martyrs, to be the sooner with their <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
whom they so much talked of. O cruel <span class="smcap">Neros</span>! that could
kill, through malice, such worthy men, as have often preached
to our dear father [<i><span class="smcap">Henry</span> VIII</i>.] and brother [<i><span class="smcap">Edward</span> VI</i>.]
the everlasting gospel of GOD. Could neither honourable
age, innocent single life, chaste matrimony, inviolate virginity,
nor yet pity move you to cease shedding of blood! Alas, too
much unnaturalness!"</p>

<p>Whether the sight of this simple book, I say, should bring
to her Grace's natural heart, the passions of heaviness or joy,
I doubt: but I think rather both.</p>

<p>Therefore, would to God! it were worthy to enter into the
hands of so noble and natural a Princess and Queen; whom
the LORD, of His eternal and foreseeing determination, hath
now placed in this royal dignity: to the redress of such unnatural
and bloody facts, as in this book are contained.</p>

<p>But forasmuch as some imperfection is, and may easily be
in this Gathering; I commend it to thy goodness, gentle
Reader! beseeching thee, not to be precise in perusing the
day; for it may, that, either through my negligence, or [that
of] some other writing [<i>manuscript</i>] before me, we may miss
so narrow a mark.</p>

<p class="center">Such as it is, I commend
unto thee! only, judge
well!

<p>There is but little doubt that the gross negligence whereby Calais was
lost to us, was but the natural outcome of the national demoralization
occasioned by the public administration of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>; which placed
all Laymen at the mercy of the Spiritualty, and all Englishmen at the
command of the Spaniard. Looking back, all now acknowledge
that the loss of Calais was a gain to England, as well as to France:
but for a time, it did sting Englishmen to the quick; and that, all
the more, seeing it was lost in a war in which we were only fighting
<span class="smcap">Philip</span>'s battles, and had no real concern ourselves.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">For</span> if ought were won by the having of St. Quentin,
England got nothing at all; for the gain thereof
came only to King <span class="smcap">Philip</span>: but the loss of Calais,
Hammes, and Guisnes, with all the country on
that side of the sea, which followed soon after,
was such a buffet to England as [had] not happened in more
than an hundred years before; and a dishonour wherewith
this realm shall be blotted until GOD shall give power to
redubbe it with some like requital to the French.</p>

<p>At this time, although open hostility and war were between
England and France, yet, contrary to the ancient custom
afore used, the town of Calais and the forts thereabouts were
not supplied with any new accrues [<i>reinforcements</i>] of soldiers;
which negligence was not unknown to the enemy, who, long
before, had practised [<i>plotted</i>] the winning of the said town and
country. The French King therefore (being sharply nettled
with the late loss of St. Quentin and a great piece of his
country adjoining, and desirous of revenge) thought it not
meet to let slip this occasion; and having presently a full
army in a readiness to employ where most advantage should
appear, determined to put in proof, with all speed, the enterprise
of Calais; which long, and many times before, was
purposed upon.</p>

<p>This practice [<i>design</i>] was not so secret but that the
Deputies of Calais and Guisnes had some intelligence
thereof; and informed the Queen [<span class="smcap">Mary</span>] and her Council
accordingly: nevertheless, either by wilful negligence there,
or lack of credit by the Queen's Council here, this great case
was so slenderly regarded as no provision of defence was
made until it was somewhat too late.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> [<i>known as, Le Balafr&eacute;</i>], being General
of the French army, proceeded in this enterprise with marvellous
policy. For approaching the English frontier [<i>known</i>
<i>in our history as the English Pale</i>], under colour to victual
Boulogne and Ardes; he entered upon the same, on a sudden
[<i>on 1st January, 1558</i>]; and took a little bulwark [<i>fortification</i>]
called Sandgate, by assault. He then divided his army into
two parts, sending one part with certain great pieces of
artillery along the downs [<i>sandhills</i>] by the seaside towards
Risbank [<i>or Ruisbank, a detached fort in Calais harbour. See</i>
<i>Vol. II. p. 39</i>]; and the other part, furnished also with battery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
pieces, marched straight forth to Newnham [<i>or Newhaven</i>]
Bridge: meaning to batter the two forts, both at one time.
Which thing he did with such celerity, that coming thither very
late in the evening, he was master of both by the next morning.</p>

<p>At the first shot discharged at Newnham Bridge, the head
of the Master Gunner of that piece [<i>fort</i>], whose name was
<span class="smcap">Horseley</span>, was clean stricken off. The Captain [<i><span class="smcap">Nicholas</span></i>
<i><span class="smcap">Alexander</span></i>] considering the great power of the French
army; and having his fort but slenderly manned to make
sufficient resistance, fled to Calais. And by the time he was
come thither, the other part of the French army that went
by the seaside, with their battery, had won Risbank; being
abandoned [<i>by Captain <span class="smcap">John Harlestone</span></i>] to their hands.</p>

<p>The next day [<i>2nd of January</i>], the Frenchmen, with five
double-cannons and three culverins, began a battery from
the sandhills next Risbank, against the town of Calais; and
continued the same, by the space of two or three days, until
they made a little breach in the wall next unto the Water
Gate, which, nevertheless, was not yet assaultable: for that
which was broken in the day, was by them within the town
made up again in the night, stronger than afore. But the
battery was not begun there by the French because they intended
to enter in that place; but rather to abuse [<i>deceive</i>] the
English, to have the less regard to the defence of the Castle:
which was the weakest part of the town, and the place where
they were we ascertained, by their espials, to win an easy entry.</p>

<p>So that while our people travailed fondly to defend that
counterfeit breach of the town wall, the Duke had in the
mean season, planted fifteen double-cannons against the
Castle. Which Castle being considered by the Rulers of
the town to be of no such force as might resist the battery of
cannon, by reason that it was old, and without any rampires
[<i>ramparts</i>]; it was devised to make a train with certain
barrels of powder to this purpose, that when the Frenchmen
should enter, as they well knew, that there they would, to
have fired the said train, and blown up the Keep: and for
that purpose left never a man within to defend it. But the
Frenchmen, at their entry, espied the train, and so avoided
the same. So that the device came to no purpose; and,
without any resistance, they entered the Castle; and thought
to have entered the town by that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>But [<i>on the 6th of January</i>] by the prowess and hardy
courage of Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Ager</span> [<i><span class="smcap">Aucher</span></i>], Knight [<i>see Vol. I.,</i>
<i>pp. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, <a href="#Page_36">36</a></i>], and Marshal of the Town, with his soldiers, they
were repulsed and driven back again into the Castle: and
followed so hard after, that our men forced them to close
and shut the Castle gate for their surety, lest it should have
been recovered against them. As it was once attempted
[<i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_199">199</a>] by Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Ager</span>: who there, with his son and heir,
and a Pursuivant at Arms called <span class="smcap">Calais</span>, and divers others, to
the number of fifteen or sixteen Englishmen, lost their lives.</p>

<p>The same night, after the recule [<i>retreat</i>] of the Frenchmen,
whose number so increased in the Castle, that the town
was not able to resist their force; the Lord <span class="smcap">Wentworth</span>,
Deputy of Calais, sent a Pursuivant called <span class="smcap">Guisnes</span>, unto
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>, requiring composition; which, after long
debate, was agreed to, upon this sort.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First. That the town, with all the great artillery,
victuals and munition, should be freely yielded to the
French King.</p>

<p>The lives of the inhabitants only saved; to whom safe
conduct should be granted, to pass where they listed.</p>

<p>Saving the Lord Deputy, with fifty others, such as the
Duke should appoint, to remain prisoners; and be put
to their ransom.</p></div>

<p>The next morning [<i>7th of January</i>], the Frenchmen entered
and possessed the Town: and forthwith all the men, women,
and children, were commanded to leave their houses, and to
go into the two churches, of Our Lady, and Saint Nicholas;
upon pain of death. Where they remained a great part of
that day, and one whole night, and until three o'clock at
afternoon the next day [<i>8th</i>]: without either meat or drink.</p>

<p>And while they were thus in the churches, the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Guise</span>, in the name of the French King, in their hearing,
made a Proclamation straitly charging and commanding all
and every person that were inhabitants of the Town of
Calais, having about them any money, plate, or jewels to the
value of [<i>but</i>] one groat [4<i>d.</i>] to bring the same forthwith,
and lay it down on the high altars of the said churches,
upon pain of death: bearing them in hand [<i>inducing them</i>
<i>to think</i>] also that they should be searched.</p>

<p>By reason of which Proclamation, there was made a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and sorrowful Offertory. And while they were at this offering
within the churches, the Frenchmen entered into their
houses, and rifled the same; where was found inestimable
riches and treasure, but specially of ordnance, armour, and
other munition.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, the next day at afternoon, being the
7th of January; all the Englishmen, except the Lord Deputy
and the others reserved for prisoners, were suffered to pass
out of the town in safety; being guarded through the army
by a number of Scottish Light Horsemen.</p>

<p>There were in this town of Calais, 500 English soldiers
ordinarily, and no more: and of the townsmen, not fully
200 fighting men: a small garrison for the defence of such
a town! And there were in the whole number of men,
women, and children, as they were counted when they went
out of the gate, 4,200 persons.</p>

<p>But the Lord <span class="smcap">Wentworth</span>, Deputy of Calais; Sir <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, Captain of the Castle; [<span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">Harlestone</span>,
Captain of Risbank; <span class="smcap">Nicholas Alexander</span>, Captain of
Newn[h]ambridge; <span class="smcap">Edward Grimstone</span>, Controller; with
others of the chief of the town, to the number of fifty, as
aforesaid, such as it pleased the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> to appoint,
were sent prisoners into France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus have ye heard the discourse of the Overthrow and
Loss of the Town of Calais; the which enterprise was begun
and ended in less than eight days, to the great marvel of
the world, that a town of such strength, and so well
furnished of all things as that was, should so suddenly be
taken and conquered: but most specially, in the winter
season; what time all the country about, being marsh
ground, is commonly overflown with water.</p>

<p>The said town was won from the French by King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>
<span class="smcap">III.</span> in the time of <span class="smcap">Philip de Valois</span>, then French King: and,
being in the possession of the Kings of England, 211 years;
was, in the time of <span class="smcap">Philip</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, King and Queen of
England, lost within less than eight days being the most
notable fort that England had.</p>

<p>For the winning whereof, King <span class="smcap">Edward</span> aforesaid, in the
21st year of his reign [1346], was fain to continue a siege one
whole year or more: wherefore it was judged of all men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
that it could not have so come to pass, without some secret
treachery.</p>

<p>Here is also to be noted, that when Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span> and
her Council heard, credibly, of the Frenchmen's sudden
approach to that town; she, with all possible speed, but
somewhat too late, raised a great power for the rescue
thereof: which, if wind and weather had served, might,
haply, have brought succour thither in time. But such
terrible tempests then arose, and continued the space of four
or five days together, that the like had not been seen before
in the remembrance of man; wherefore some said "That
the same was done by necromancy, and that the Devil
was raised up, and become French:" the truth whereof is
known to GOD. But very true it is that no ship could
brook the seas, by reason of those extreme storms and
tempests. And such of the Queen's ships as did adventure
the passage, were so shaken and torn, with the violence of
the weather; as they were forced to return with great danger,
and the loss of all their tackle and furniture.</p>

<p>Thus by the negligence of the Council at home, conspiracy
of traitors elsewhere, force and false practice of enemies,
helped by the rage of most terrible tempests of contrary
winds and weather; this famous Fort of Calais was brought
again to the hands and possession of the French.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So soon as this Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>, contrary to all expectation,
had, in a few days, gained this strong town of Calais, afore
thought impregnable, and had put the same in such order as
best seemed for his advantage: proud of the spoil, and pressing
forward upon his sudden fortune, without giving long time
to the residue of the Captains of the forts there to breathe
on their business; the 13th of the same month, with all
provision requisite for a siege, he marched with his army
from Calais into the town and fort of Guisnes, five miles
distant from thence.</p>

<p>Of which town and castle, at the same time, there was as
Captain, a valiant Baron of England, called <span class="smcap">William</span>, Lord
<span class="smcap">Grey</span> of Wilton [<i>See Vol. III. p. 76</i>]: who, not without
cause suspecting a siege at hand; and knowing the town of
Guisnes to be of small force (as being without walls or
bulwarks, and only compassed with a trench), before the
Frenchmen's arrival, caused all the inhabitants of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to advoid [<i>depart</i>]; and so many of them as were apt to
bear arms, he caused to retire into the Castle. Which was
a place well fortified, with strong and massy Bulwarks
[<i>redoubts or batteries</i>] of brick: having also a high and mighty
tower, of great force and strength, called the Keep.</p>

<p>The town being thus abandoned, the Frenchman had the
more easy approach to the Castle; who, thinking to find
quiet lodging in those vacant houses, entered the same without
any fear: and being that night, at their rest as they
thought, a chosen band of soldiers, appointed by Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>,
issued out by a postern of the said Castle, and slew no small
number of their sleepy guests. The rest, they put out of
their new lodgings; and (maugre the Duke and all the French
power) consumed all the houses of the town with fire. That
notwithstanding, the said Duke, with all diligence, began his
trenches: and albeit the shot of the great artillery from the
Castle was terrible, and gave him great impeachment; yet
did he continue his work without intermission, and, for
example's sake, wrought in his own person as a common
pioneer or labourer. So that, within less than three days,
he brought, to the number of thirty-five battery pieces, hard
to the brim [<i>edge</i>] of the Castle ditch, to batter the same on
all sides, as well right forth as across. But his principal
battery, he planted against the strongest bulwark of all,
called Mary Bulwark [<i>a detached fort</i>]; thinking by gaining of
the stronger, to come more easily by the weaker.</p>

<p>His battery being thus begun, he continued the same by
the space of two days, with such terrible thundering of great
artillery, that, by the report of [<span class="smcap">F. de</span>] <span class="smcap">Rabutin</span> a French
writer, there were, in those few days, discharged well near
to the number of 8,000 or 9,000 cannon shot.</p>

<p>Through the violence whereof, by the 20th of the said
month, the said great Bulwark was laid wide open, and the
breach made reasonable and easy enough for the assault;
nevertheless, the said Duke (being a man of war, and nothing
ignorant of what devices be commonly used in forts and besieged
towns to entrap and damage the assailants) afore he
would put the persons of his good soldiers to the hazard of
the assault, caused the breach to be viewed once or twice by
certain forward and skilful soldiers; who, mounting the top
of the breach, brought report that the place was saultable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
[<i>assaultable</i>]. Nevertheless, to make the climb more easy; he
caused certain harquebussiers to pass over the ditch, and to
keep the defendants occupied with shot, while certain pioneers
with mattocks and shovels, made the breach more plain and
easy. [<i>See <span class="smcap">Churchyard</span>'s account of this assault at p. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>. He</i>
<i>was one of the defenders.</i>]</p>

<p>Which thing done accordingly, he gave order to Monsieur
<span class="smcap">D'Andelot</span>, Colonel of the French Footmen, that he, with
his Bands, should be in readiness to give the assault, when
sign should be given.</p>

<p>In which meantime, the Duke withdrew himself to an
higher ground; from whence he might plainly discover the
behaviour as well of his soldiers in giving the assault, as also
of the defendants in answering the same. And not perceiving
so many of the English part appearing for the defence, as
he looked for; he gave order forthwith, that a regiment of
his most forward Lance Knights [<i>the Reiters</i>] should mount
the breach to open the first passage, and that Monsieur
<span class="smcap">D'Andelot</span> with his Bands of the French, should back them.</p>

<p>Which order was followed with such hot haste and desperate
hardiness, that, entering a deep ditch full of water,
from the bottom whereof to the top of the breach was well
forty feet, without fear either of the water beneath or the fire
above, they mounted the breach: and whereas the Duke had
prepared divers bridges made of plank-boards, borne up with
caske and empty pipes [<i>i.e., barrels of the size of a Pipe</i>] tied
one to another, for his men to pass the said ditch; many of
the said assailants, without care of those bridges, plunged
into the water, and took the next way to come to the assault.</p>

<p>Which hot haste notwithstanding, the said assailants were,
in this first assault, so stoutly repulsed and put back by the
defendants, being furnished with great store of wild fire and
fricassees for the purpose, that they were turned down headlong,
one upon another, much faster than they came up: not without
great waste and slaughter of their best and most brave
soldiers; to the small comfort of the stout Duke, who, as is
said before, stood, all this while, upon a little hill to behold
this business. Wherefore, not enduring this sight any longer,
as a man arraged [<i>enraged</i>], he ran among his men; so reproving
some and encouraging others, that the assault was foot hot
renewed with much more vehemence and fury than before:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and with no less obstinacy and desperation received by the
defendants; whereby all the breach underneath was filled
with French carcases.</p>

<p>This notwithstanding, the Duke still redoubled his forces
with fresh companies; and continued so many assaults, one
upon another, that at the last charge, being most vehement
of all others, our men being tired, and greatly minished in the
number by slaughter and bloody wounds, were, of fine [<i>sheer</i>]
force, driven to avoid, and give place of entry to the enemy.</p>

<p>Which was not done without a marvellous expense of blood,
on both sides. For, of the French part, there were slain and
perished in these assaults, above the number of 800 or 900
[<i><span class="smcap">Churchyard</span> says, at p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>, 4,000</i>]: and of the English, but
little fewer [<i>800, p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a></i>]; amongst whom the greatest loss
lighted on the Spaniards, who took upon them the defence
of the said Mary Bulwark: insomuch, as the report went,
that of the 500 [<i>or rather 450; whereof but 50 were Spaniards,</i>
<i>the rest English and Burgundians, see p. <a href="#Page_209">209</a></i>] brave soldiers which
King <span class="smcap">Philip</span> sent thither for succour, under the conduct of a
valiant Spanish Captain, called <span class="smcap">Mount Dragon</span>, there were
not known to have come away any number worth the reckoning,
but all were either slain, maimed or taken.</p>

<p>These outrageous assaults were given to the Castle of
Guisnes, on St. Sebastian's day, the 20th of January aforesaid.</p>

<p>At the end of which day, there were also gained from the
English, two other principal Bulwarks of the said Castle;
which, being likewise made assaultable by battery, were
taken by the Almains [<i>? Swiss</i>], who entered in by the breaches.</p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, with his eldest son, and the chief Captains
and soldiers of the said garrison, who kept the Inner Ward of
the Castle, where the most high and principal Tower, called
the Keep, stood; thinking themselves in small surety there
(being a place of the old sort of fortification) after they saw
the Utter Ward possessed by the enemy, and such a number
of the most forward soldiers consumed and spent; and no
likelihood of any more aid to come in time: by the advice of
the most expert soldiers there, concluded for the best, to treat
with the Duke for composition: according to the which advice,
he sent forth two gentlemen, with this message in effect. That</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the Duke (being a man of war, and serving under a
King) should not think it strange if the Lord <span class="smcap">Grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></span>
likewise (being a man of war, and serving his Prince, in
manner) did his like deavour [<i>endeavour</i>] in well defending
the place committed to his charge, so far forth, as to
answer and bide the assault; considering that otherwise,
he could never save his own honour, neither his truth
and loyalty to his Prince. In respect whereof, according
to the law of arms, he required honourable composition.</p></div>

<p>Which message, though it was well accepted of the Duke;
yet he deferred his answer until the morrow. What [<i>At</i>
<i>which</i>] time, the messengers repairing to him again, composition
was granted in this sort.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First. That the Castle with all the furniture thereof,
as well victuals as great artillery, powder, and other
munitions of war, should be wholly rendered; without
wasting, hiding, or minishment thereof.</p>

<p>Secondarily. That the Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, with all the
Captains, Officers, and others having charge there,
should remain prisoners, at the Duke's pleasure; to be
ransomed after the manner of war.</p>

<p>Thirdly. That all the rest, as well soldiers as others,
should safely depart, with their armour and baggage to
what parts, it seemed them best: nevertheless, to pass,
without sound of drum or trumpet, or displaying of an
ensigns [<i>flags</i>]; but to leave them behind.</p></div>

<p>These conditions being received and approved on either
party, the day following, that is to wit, the 22nd day of the
said month of January, all the soldiers of the said fortress, as
well English as strangers, with all the rest of the inhabitants
and others (except the Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> his son, Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry Palmer</span> Knight, <span class="smcap">Mount Dragon</span> the above named
Captain of the Spaniards, and other men of charge reserved by
the Composition) departed, with their bag and baggages, from
thence, towards Flanders. At whose issuing forth, there was
esteemed [<i>estimated</i>] to the number of 800 or 900 able men for
the war: part English, part Burgundians, with a small
remnant of Spaniards.</p>

<p>After the winning of this town and Castle, the Duke, advising
well upon the place, and considering that if it should
happen to be regained by Englishmen, what a noisome
neighbour the same might be to Calais, now being French;
and specially what impeachment should come thereby for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
passage thither from France; considering also the near
standing thereof to the French King's fortress of Ardes, so
that to keep two garrisons so nigh together should be but a
double charge, and not only needless, but also dangerous, for
the cause afore rehearsed: upon these considerations, as the
Frenchmen write, he took order for all the great artillery,
victuals, and other munition to be taken forth; and the
Castle, with all the Bulwarks and other fortifications there,
to be razed and thrown down, with all speed, and the stuff to
be carried away, and employed in other more necessary places.</p>

<p>Then there rested nothing, within all the English Pale on
that side, unconquered, but the little Castle or Pile called
Hammes: which, though it were but of small force, made by
art and industry of man's hand, and altogether of old workmanship,
without rampiers [<i>ramparts</i>] or Bulwarks [<i>redoubts</i>];
yet, nevertheless, by the natural situation thereof, being environed
on all sides, with fens and marsh grounds, it could not
easily be approached unto: either with great ordnance for the
battery, or else with an army to encamp there, for a siege;
having but one straight passage thereto by a narrow causey
[<i>causeway</i>], traversed and cut through, in divers places, with
deep ditches always full of water. Which thing, being well
foreseen by <span class="smcap">Edward</span> Lord <span class="smcap">Dudley</span>, then Captain there, having
as good cause to suspect a siege there as his neighbours,
had, afore the Frenchmen's coming to Guisnes, caused all the
bridges of the said causey, which were of wood, to be broken;
to give thereby the more impeachment [<i>obstacles</i>] to the French,
if they should attempt to approach the same; as, shortly
after, they did, and kept divers of the passages.</p>

<p>But to deliver the Duke and his soldiers from that care,
there came to him glad news from those that had charge to
watch the same causey; how the Captain, having intelligence
of the rendering of Guisnes, had conveyed himself with his
small garrison, secretly, the same night [<i>of the 22nd of January</i>]
by a secret passage over the marshes into Flanders. Whereby,
the Duke, being now past care of any further siege to be
laid in all that frontier, took order forthwith to seize the said
little fort into his hands; as it was easy to do, when there
was no resistance.</p>

<p>When this place was once seized by the French, then
remained there none other place or strength of the English on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
all that side the sea, for the safeguard of the rest of the
country: whereby the French King became wholly and
thoroughly Lord and Master of all the English Pale: for now,
as ye have heard, there was neither town, castle, or fortress,
more or less, on that side (saving Bootes Bulwark, near to
Gravelines; which now, [<i>in 1568</i>] King <span class="smcap">Philip</span> keepeth as
his); but it was either taken away by force, or else abandoned
and left open to the enemy. And, as the Frenchmen write,
besides the great riches of gold and silver coin, jewels, plate,
wool, and other merchandise (which was inestimable [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>beyond reckoning</i>]) there were found 300 pieces of brass,
mounted on wheels, and as many pieces of iron: with such
furniture of powder, pellets [<i>bullets</i>], armour, victuals, and
other munitions of war, scarcely credible [<i>see p. <a href="#Page_250">250</a></i>].</p>

<p>Thus have heard the whole discourse of the Conquest of
the noble town of Calais with all the English fortresses and
country adjoining, made by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>. The news
whereof, when it came to the French King: [<i>there is</i>] no need
to ask how joyfully it was received! not only by him and all
his Court, but also universally through the whole realm of
France. For the which victory, there was, as the manner is,
<i>Te DEUM</i> sung, and bonfires made everywhere, as it is
wont to be in cases of common joy and gladness for some
rare benefit of GOD. Shortly, upon this conquest, there was
a public Assembly at Paris of all the Estates of France: who
frankly (in recompense of the King's charges in winning
Calais and the places aforesaid, and for maintenance of his
wars to be continued afterwards) granted unto him 3,000,000
of French Crowns [<i>= about &pound;900,000 then = about &pound;9,000,000</i>
<i>now</i>]; whereof the clergy of France contributed 1,000,000
crowns besides their <i>d&icirc;mes</i>.</p>

<p>And no marvel though the French did highly rejoice at the
recovery of Calais out of the Englishmen's hands! For it is
constantly affirmed by many that be acquainted with the affairs
of France, that ever since the town was first won by the
Englishmen, in all solemn Councils appointed to treat upon
the state of France, there was a special person appointed to
put them in remembrance, from time to time, of Calais: as it
were to be wished that the like were used in England until it
were regained from the French.</p>

<p>Now seemed every day a year, to the French King, until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
personally had visited Calais and his new conquered country.
Wherefore, about the end of January, aforesaid, he took his
voyage thither, accompanied with no small number of his
nobility. And immediately upon his arrival there, he perused
the whole town and every part thereof, from place to place:
and devising with the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> for the better fortification
thereof; what should be added to the old, what should
be made new, and what should be taken away. And after
order taken for that business; he placed there a noble and
no less valiant Knight, called Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Thermes</span>, to be
Captain of the town: and so departed again to France.</p>

<p>After the French King's departure from Calais, he made
great haste for the accomplishment of the marriage moved
between <span class="smcap">Francis</span>, his eldest son, called the Dauphin, and
<span class="smcap">Mary Stuart</span>, daughter and sole heir of <span class="smcap">James V.</span>, late
King of Scotland: which Princess (if the Scots had been
faithful of promise, as they seldom be) should have married
with King <span class="smcap">Edward VI.</span> For the breach of which promise,
began all the war between England and Scotland, in the latter
end of King <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span> and in the beginning of <span class="smcap">Edward</span>
<span class="smcap">VI.</span> [<i>See <span class="smcap">Patten</span>'s account of the Wooing, Vol. III. p. 51.</i>]</p>

<p>This marriage (though it be not my matter) I thought not
to omit; for many things were meant thereby, which, thanks
be to GOD! never came to pass. But one special point was
not hidden to the world, that, by the means of the same, the
Realm of Scotland should, for evermore, have remained as
united and incorporated to the Crown of France; that as
the Son and Heir of every French King doth succeed to the
inheritance and possession of a country, called the Doulphyn
[<i>Dauphin&eacute;</i>], and is therefore called Doulphyn [<i>Dauphin</i>]; and
as the Principality of Wales appertaineth to the Eldest Son of
England, who is therefore called the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>: even so,
that the Dauphin and Heir of France should thereby have been
King of Scotland, for evermore. Which name and title, upon
this marriage, was accordingly given to <span class="smcap">Francis</span> the Dauphin
and heir apparent of France, to be called "King Dauphin":
the meaning whereof was, utterly to exclude for evermore any
to be King of Scotland, but only the Eldest Son of France.</p>

<p>This memorable marriage was solemnized in the city of
Paris, the 24th day of April, 1558, with most magnificent
pomp and triumph.</p>

to cut over the marsh from Sandgate and get between
ours and the Bridge, and then to have hotly set on them on
both sides. In this time also, at a venture, I had caused
your Majesty's Marshal, with the horsemen, to go abroad,
and maintain the skirmish with the footmen: and by that
[<i>time</i>] the Marshal came there, the enemy's harquebussiers
that passed the marshes were discovered; and ours took a
very honest retire. Which the enemies on the land side perceiving,
came on, both horsemen and footmen, marvellously
hotly; to whom ours gave divers onsets, continually skirmishing
till they came to the Bridge, and there reposed
themselves. The bridge bestowed divers shot upon the
enemy, and hurt some. Of ours, thanked be GOD! none slain
nor hurt, save a man-at-arms stricken in the leg with a currion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The alarm continued till one o'clock in the afternoon;
before the end whereof our enemy's number increased: for
eleven ensigns more of footmen came in sight, and three
troops of horsemen.</p>

<p>Besides, the alarm went round about our country at that
instant, even from Sandgate to Guisnes; and bands of the
enemy at every passage.</p>

<p>They have gotten Froyton Church, and plant themselves
at all the streights [<i>passages</i>] into this country. The bulwarks
[<i>? earth works</i>] of Froyton and Nesle have this day done their
duty very well; to whom I have this afternoon sent aid of
men, and some shot and powder. Howbeit I am in some
doubt of Nesle this night.</p>

<p>I am perfectly advertised, their number of horsemen and
footmen already arrived is above 12,000; whereof little less
have come in sight here. The Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> is not yet
arrived, but [is] hourly looked for with a more [<i>greater</i>]
number.</p>

<p>This evening, I have discovered 500 waggons ladened with
victuals and munition; and have further perfect intelligence,
that thirty cannons be departed from Boulogne hitherwards.</p>

<p>They [<i>i.e., the French army</i>] are settled at Sandgate, Galley
Moat, Causeway, Froyton, Calkewell, Nesle, and Syntrecase.
At one o'clock after midnight, I look for them; being low
water at the passage over the haven.</p>

<p>Thus having set all things in the best order I can, I make
an end of three days' work; and leave your Majesty to consider
for our speedy succour. Beseeching GOD to grant
your Highness victory, with long and prosperous reign.</p>

<p>At your town of Calais, this New Year's Day, at nine of
the night, 1557.</p>

<p>I have received your Majesty's letter [<i>of 31st December</i>] by
[<span class="smcap">John Highfield</span>] Master of the Ordnance [at Calais], who
came in this morning. The contents whereof I follow as

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">After</span> my humble duty remembered, it may please
your Highness. This last night our enemies lay
still, without anything attempting in the places
mentioned in my last letters; as we did well
perceive, during the whole night, by great fires
made in the same places.</p>

<p>This morning early, I put out fresh footmen to the Bridge,
to relieve the watched men.</p>

<p>About nine a clock, the enemies in very great number
approached the Bridge, and offered the skirmish: whereupon
issued out some of our harquebussiers and bowmen, and kept
them in play, with the help of the shot from the Bridge, more
than an hour; and in the end, being overmatched with
multitude, made their retire with the Turnpike, without any
loss or hurt. The enemies shadowing [<i>sheltering</i>] themselves
under the turnpike wall, with their curriors (which assuredly
shot very great bullets, and carry far) kept themselves in
such surety, as our pieces of the Bridge could not annoy
them, till at eleven o'clock, certain of ours, bored holes with
augers through the turnpike, and with harquebusses beat
them out into the shot of ordnance, and so made them retire
to the Causeway.</p>

<p>This forenoon, certain Swiss and Frenchmen, to the
number of 500, got within the marshes between Froyton and
Nesle bulwarks: and the men of the Bulwarks seeing themselves
to be compassed on all sides, and seeing also that time
yet served them well to depart; and (fearing they should not
so do, if they tarried till they were assailed on both sides, as
they could not indeed), forsook their Bulwarks, and right
manfully, notwithstanding their enemies between them and
home, saved themselves through the marshes. In the retire
of the enemies, one <span class="smcap">Cookson</span>, a man-at-arms, and few other
soldiers, with the countrymen, rescued most part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
booty (which was certain kine); and took three prisoners of
the Captain of Abbeville's Band.</p>

<p>The report of this enterprise of the enemy being brought
to me, fearing Colham Hill, I forthwith appointed your
Majesty's Marshal with the Horsemen, and 200 footmen to
repair thither; and as they should see their match, so to
demean themselves. Ere these men had marched a quarter
of a mile, the enemies were retired out of the country, upon
occasion that wading, as they entered in, up to the girdle
stead; and perceiving the water to increase, [they] thought
good to make a speedy return: and nevertheless, for all their
haste, went up to the breast. And if they had tarried a little
longer, I had put in so much water, as I think would have
put them over head and ears: and, GOD willing, at the next
tide, I will take in more.</p>

<p>This afternoon, they have been quiet, and we, in the
meantime, be occupied in cutting up of passages to let in
more water about the Bridge and that part of the marshes;
whereby the enemies shall have very ill watering.</p>

<p>I would also take in the salt water about the town [<i>of</i>
<i>Calais</i>], but I cannot do it, by reason I should infect our
own water wherewith we brew: and, notwithstanding all I
can do, our brewers be so behindhand in grinding and otherwise,
as we shall find that one of our greatest lacks. I
therefore make all the haste and provision I can there, and
howsoever the matter go, must shortly be forced to let in
the salt water.</p>

<p>The three men taken to-day be very ragged, and ill-appointed.
In examining, they confess that "there is great
misery in their camp, and great want of money and victuals."
They say (and I partly believe it, because it almost appeareth
to me), "their number to be 25,000 footmen, whereof 10,000
[are] Swiss; and 10,000 horsemen. The Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>
is already among them, and the only deviser and leader of
this enterprise." They say also, "a shot from the Bridgeway
to the Causeway yesterday, struck off the Master of the
Camp's leg, called Captain <span class="smcap">Gourdault</span>."</p>

<p>I am also perfectly advertised, both by these men and
otherwise, that they have no great ordnance yet come, but
look for it daily by sea. It is eighty pieces, whereof thirty be
cannons: and are laden, with munition and victuals, in 140<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
vessels which shall land at Sandgate; or rather I think at
Boulogne, it to be taken out of great ships [there], and so
again embarked at Sandgate in lesser vessels, as they have
done most part of their victuals and carriage that they have
hitherto occupied [<i>used</i>]. And, surely, if your Majesty's ships
had been on this shore, they might either have letted
[<i>hindered</i>] their voyage; or, at the least, very much hindered
it: and not unlike[ly] to have distressed them, being only
small boats. Their ordnance that comes, shall be conveyed
in the same sort: it may therefore please your Majesty to
consider it.</p>

<p>I have also now fully discovered their enterprise; and am
(as a man may be) most sure they will first attempt upon
Rysbanke; and that way chiefly assail the town. Marry! I
think they lie hovering in the country, for the coming of
their great artillery, and also to be masters of the sea.
And therefore I trust your Highness will haste over all things
necessary for us with expedition.</p>

<p>Under your Majesty's reformation [<i>correction</i>], I think, if
you please to set the passage at liberty for all men to come
that would, bringing sufficient victuals for themselves for a
season; I am of opinion there would be enow, and with more
speed than can be made by order. Marry! then must
it well be foreseen to transport with expedition, victuals
hither.</p>

<p>I have written to the King's Majesty [<span class="smcap">Philip II.</span>] of the
enemies being here: and was bold humbly to beseech his
Majesty to give commission to the governors of his frontiers
[that] I might, in necessity, upon my letter, have 300 or
400 harquebussiers, Spaniards, that now be placed about St.
Omer; whereof I thought it my duty to advertise your
Majesty, for your pleasure, whether I may write to the
Governors to that effect, upon his Majesty's answer, and
take them or not?</p>

<p>I, with the rest of the Council here, are forced to put your
Majesty to some charges: for having taken in a confused
number of countrymen [<i>i.e., peasantry within the English Pale</i>],
we must needs reduce them to order, and the commoners
also; and have therefore called them into wages, and
appointed Captains of the fittest men that presently [<i>at this</i>
<i>moment</i>] be here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>I have placed <span class="smcap">Dodd</span> with his Band in Rysbank, and the
rest of the extraordinary [<i>i.e., volunteer</i>] Bands be at the
Bridge, and in the Brayes of this town.</p>

<p>As I was making this discourse, six Ensigns [<i>regiments</i>] of
footmen, and certain Bands [<i>troops</i>] of horsemen, came from
Sandgate by the downs, within the sight of Rysbank: on
whom, that piece, and this town also, bestowed divers shots.</p>

<p>This evening, they have made their approach to Rysbank,
without any artillery: and, as far as I can perceive, do mind
to make the assault with ladders, hurdles, &amp;c., and other
things, and that way get it.</p>

<p>At Calais, the 2nd of January, at ten in the night, 1557.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I was in communication with your Mayor and Aldermen,
touching the state of this town (whom I find of marvellous
good courage, and ready to live and die in this town), I
received letters from my Lords of the Council, of your
Majesty's aid provided for us.</p>

<p>I fear this shall be my last letter, for that the enemy will
stop my passage; but I will do what I can tidily [<i>duly from</i>
<i>time to time</i>] to signify unto your Majesty, our state.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Pleaseth</span> it your Highness to understand the
Declaration of your humblest and faithful servant
<span class="smcap">John Highfield</span>, concerning the besieging and
loss of your Grace's town of Calais.</p>

<p>First, being appointed by your most honourable
Council [<i>i.e., the Privy Council in London</i>] to repair into
England [<i>on the previous 23rd May, see p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a></i>]; I came. And
after some intelligence that the French Army drew towards
the English Pale, I was commanded to return with diligence
to my charge at Calais; and I arrived there on New Year's
Day in the morning, the enemy being encamped about
Sandgate.</p>

<p>The said morning, after I had delivered letters to my
Lord Deputy, from your Grace's said Council, the said Lord
Deputy told me how the alarm was made the night before,
and also what he thought meet for me to be done for the
better furniture of those fortresses which were in most
danger, as the Bulwarks of the High Country [<i>Froyton and</i>
<i>Nesle</i>], Guisnes, Newhaven Bridge, and Rysbank: and also
for the defence of the Low Country, because his Lordship
thought their enterprise had tended only to the spoil thereof.
Then I showed that there was a sufficient store of all munitions,
and that I would send to all places as need required;
which was done.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> On Sunday following [<i>2nd January, 1558</i>], we perceived
the French ordnance was brought to their camp;
whereby appeared that the enemy meant to batter some
place: and thereupon were two mounts repaired for the
better defence. At the same time, I desired to have some
pioneers appointed to help the cannoneers, who were not
forty in number, for the placing and entrenching of our great
ordnance; which pioneers I could never get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The same day, the enemy forced our men to forsake the
Bulwarks of the High Country. And then it was moved to
my Lord Deputy that the sea might be let in, as well to
drown the Causeway beyond Newhaven Bridge, as also
other places about the town: wherein was answered, "Not
to be necessary without more appearance of besieging," and
because that "the sea being entered in, should hinder the
pastures of the cattle, and also the brewing of the beer."</p>

<p>The same day, my Lord took order that victuals and other
necessaries should be sent to Newhaven Bridge for six days;
which was done.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> On Monday [<i>3rd January</i>] in the morning, my Lord
Deputy, with the rest of the Council there, perceiving that
the enemy intended to approach nearer, were in doubt
whether they might abandon the Low Country: and by
advice, my Lord gave order that the Bailiff of Marke should
appoint the servants and women of the Low Country, with
their superfluous cattle, to draw (if need happened) into the
Flemish Pale; and the said Bailiff with his best men, to
repair to Marke Church, and there to abide further orders.</p>

<p>The same morning before day, the enemy had made their
approaches, and did batter both Newhaven Bridge and the
Rysbank; which were given up before nine o'clock.</p>

<p>The Captain of Newhaven Bridge had word sent him that
if he saw no remedy to avoid the danger, that then he should
retire with his company into the Town.</p>

<p>The Captain of Rysbank did, about the same time,
surrender; because, as he told me since, his pieces were all
dismounted, and the soldiers very loth to tarry at the breach:
wherein I know no more.</p>

<p>But after the enemy was entered, I cause the said
Rysbank to be battered; and when my Lord saw how little
it profited, he commanded to cease.</p>

<p>The same day, the passages being both lost, the enemy
planted their ordnance on the Sand Hill, to batter the north
side of the town; and then I moved my Lord to call in as
many countrymen [<i>English peasantry</i>] as he could, and to
appoint them Captains and their several quarters, for the
relief of those which did most commonly watch and attend
on the walls. Who answered, "He had determined already
so to do." Howbeit the women did more labour [<i>watch</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
about the ramparts than the said countrymen; which, for
lack of order in time, did absent themselves in houses and
other secret places.</p>

<p>The same evening, Captain <span class="smcap">Saligues</span> [<i>or <span class="smcap">Sellyn</span></i>] came
into Calais; whereupon the people rejoiced, hoping some succour:
but after that time, it was too late to receive help by land,
because the French horsemen were entered the Low Country.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> On Tuesday [<i>4th January</i>] in the morning, the
enemy began their battery to the Town; on which side I had
placed fourteen brass pieces. Howbeit, within short time,
the enemy having so commodious a place, did dismount
certain of our best pieces, and consumed some of the
gunners, which stood very open for lack of mounds and
good fortification. For if the rampart had been finished,
then might divers pieces have been brought from other
places; which were above sixty in number, ready mounted:
but lacking convenient place, and chiefly cannoneers and
pioneers, it was hard to displace the French battery. Which
counter battery could not have been maintained for lack of
powder. For, at the beginning, having in store, 400 barrels;
I found there was spent within five days, 100.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> On Wednesday [<i>5th January</i>], the enemy continued
their battery on the town, without great hurt done, because
they could not beat the foot of the wall, for that the <i>contremure</i>
was of a good height, and we reinforced the breach, in the
night, with timber, wool, and other matter sufficiently; and
we looked that the enemy would have attempted the assault
the same evening; whereupon I caused two flankers to be
made ready, and also placed two bombards, by the help of
the soldiers, appointing weapons and fireworks to be in readiness
at the said breach. At which time, my Lord commanded
the soldiers of the garrison to keep their ordinary wards, and
Master <span class="smcap">Grimston</span> to the breach with the residue of the best
soldiers. And then my Lord exhorted all men to fight, with
other good words as in such cases appertaineth. And my
Lord told me, divers times, that "although there came no
succour; yet he would never yield, nor stand to answer the
loss of such a town."</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> On Thursday [<i>6th January</i>], began one other battery
to the Castle; which being a high and weak wall without
ramparts, was made [as]saultable the same day. Whereupon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the Captain of the Castle desired some more help to defend
this breach, or else to know what my Lord thought best in
that behalf. Then, after long debating, my Lord determined
to have the towers overthrown, which one <span class="smcap">Saulle</span> took upon
him to do; notwithstanding, I said openly that "if the Castle
were abandoned, it should be the loss of the Town."</p>

<p>The same night, my Lord appointed me to be at the breach
of the town with him: and, about eight of the clock, the
enemy waded over the haven, at the low water, with certain
harquebussiers, to view the breaches; and, coming to the
Castle, found no resistance, and so entered. Then the said
<span class="smcap">Saulle</span> failed to give fire unto the train of powder [<i>see p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a></i>].</p>

<p>Then my Lord, understanding that the enemy were entered
into the Castle, commanded me to give order for battering
of the Castle; whereupon incontinent there were bent three
cannons and one saker [<i>p. <a href="#Page_251">251</a></i>] before the gate, to beat the
bridge; which, being in the night, did not greatly annoy.</p>

<p>The same time, Master Marshall [<i>Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Aucher</span>,</i>
<i>see p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a></i>] with divers soldiers, came towards the Castle,
lest the enemy should enter the town also. And after we had
skirmished upon the bridge, seeing no remedy to recover
the Castle, we did burn and break the said bridge: and there
was a trench immediately cast before the Castle, which was
[the] only help at that time.</p>

<p>Within one hour after, upon necessity of things, [my Lord]
determined to send a trumpet with a herald, declaring that
"If the Frenchmen would send one gentleman, then he would
send one other in gage." Whereupon my Lord sent for me,
and commanded that I should go forth of the town for the
same purpose; wherein I desired his Lordship that he would
send some other, and rather throw me over the walls. Then
he spake likewise to one <span class="smcap">Windebanke</span>, and to <span class="smcap">Massingberd</span>,
as I remember, which were both to go unto such service.</p>

<p>Then my Lord sent for me again, in <span class="smcap">Peyton</span>'s house; and
being eftsoons commanded by the Council there, I went forth
with a trumpet [<i>trumpeter</i>], and received in a French gentleman:
who, as I heard, was brought to my Lord Deputy's
house, and treated upon some Articles; which were brought,
within one hour, by one <span class="smcap">Hall</span>, merchant of the staple.</p>

<p>Then Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Andelot</span> entered the town with certain
French gentlemen; and the said <span class="smcap">Hall</span> and I were brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Guise</span>, who lay in the sand hills by Rysbank,
and there the said <span class="smcap">Hall</span> delivered a bill: and we were sent
to Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Estrees</span>' tent.</p>

<p>The Friday after [<i>7th January</i>], Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Estrees</span> told
me that my Lord Deputy had agreed to render the town with
loss of all the goods, and fifty prisoners to remain.</p>

<p>On Saturday [<i>8th January</i>], he brought me into the town,
willing me to tell him what ordnance, powder, and other
houses did belong unto my office; because he would reserve
the same from spoiling by the French soldiers. And after he
had knowledge that all my living was on that side [<i>i.e., he had</i>
<i>only his Mastership of the Ordnance at Calais</i>], he was content
that I should depart into Flanders.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, I was driven off till Wednesday, [<i>12th</i>
<i>January</i>]. Then he said, "He would send me away, if I
would promise him to make suit that his son might be returned
in exchange for the Captain of the Castle," who, being
prisoner, desired me also to travail in it, for he would rather
give 3,000 crowns [<i>= &pound;900 then = about &pound;9,000 now</i>], than remain
a prisoner. Whereupon I promised to inquire and
labour in the same matter to the best of my power.</p>

<p>On my said return into the town, I found my wife, which
showed me that, in my absence, she had bestowed my money
and plate to the value of &pound;600 [<i>= about &pound;6,000 now</i>]; which
was found before my coming, saving one bag with 350 crowns
[<i>= &pound;105 = about &pound;1,000 now</i>], which I offered to give unto
Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Estrees</span> if he would promise me, on his honour,
to despatch me on horseback to Gravelines [<i>then held by the</i>
<i>Spaniards</i>]. Which he did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And there I met with Monsieur <span class="smcap">de Vandeville</span>, to whom
I told, that "I thought the enemy would visit him shortly";
and, among other things, I inquire where Monsieur
<span class="smcap">D'Estrees</span>' son did lay; who told me, "He was at Bruges."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, at my coming to Dunkirk, there were divers Englishmen
willing to serve [<i>i.e., in <span class="smcap">Philip II.</span>'s army</i>]: whereupon I
spake to the Captain of the town; who advised me to move
it to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Savoy</span>.</p>

<p>Then I rode to Bruges, beseeching him to consider the
poor men, and how willing they were to serve the King's
Majesty, if they might be employed. Then he answered, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
he "thought my Lord of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> would shortly arrive at
Dunkirk and then he would take order."</p>

<p>Further, the said Duke asked me, "After what sort the
town was lost?"</p>

<p>I answered that "The cause was not only by the weakness
of the Castle, and the lack of men; but also I thought there
was some treason, for, as I heard, there were some escaped
out of the town: and the Frenchmen told me, that they had
intelligence of all our estate within the town."</p>

<p>Then I put the Duke in remembrance of Guisnes; who
told me, that "he would succour the Castle, if it were kept
four or five days."</p>

<p>Then I took leave to depart from him, and when I was
going out of the house, he sent his Captain of his Guard to
commit me to prison, where I have remained nine weeks,
[<i>January-March, 1558</i>], without any matter laid to my charge;
saving he sent to me, within fourteen days after, to declare
in writing, after what sort the town was lost, which I did as
nigh as I could remember.</p>

<p>And at the Duke's next return to Bruges, I sent him a
supplication, desiring that, if any information were made
against me, I might answer it in England, or otherwise at
his pleasure.</p>

<p>She will have been advertised that, soon after the French had
entered Calais, <span class="smcap">John Highfield</span>, late Master of the Artillery

been an understanding between him and the French, had
caused him to be arrested and detained at Bruges, where he
has been until now.</p>

<p>Lately, while repassing through that town, was importuned
by the prisoner's wife to set him free. Sends her under the

few, or none at all, of so many that favoured <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">My</span> most bounden duty humbly premised to your
Majesty. Whereas I have heretofore always in
effect written nothing to your Highness but good,
touching the service and state of your places
here; I am now constrained, with woful heart,
to signify unto your Majesty these ensuing.</p>

<p>The French have won Newhaven Bridge, and thereby
entered into all the Low Country and the marshes between
this [<i>Guisnes</i>] and Calais. They have also won Rysbanke,
whereby they be now master of that haven.</p>

<p>And this last night past, they have placed their ordnance
of battery against Calais, and are encamped at St. Peter's
Heath before it: so that I now am clean cut off from all
relief and aid which I looked to have (both out of England,
and from Calais) and know not how to have help by any
means, either of men or victuals.</p>

<p>There resteth now none other way for the succour of
Calais and the rest of your Highness's pieces on this side,
but a power of men out of England, or from the King's
Majesty [<span class="smcap">Philip II.</span>]; or from both, without delay, able to
distress and keep them from victuals coming to them, as well
by sea as land; which shall force them to leave their siege
to the battle, or else drive them to a greater danger.</p>

<p>For lack of men out of England, I shall be forced to
abandon the Town [<i>of Guisnes</i>], and take in the soldiers
thereof for the Castle. I have made as good provision of
victuals as I could, by any means, out of the country; with
which, GOD willing! I doubt not to defend and keep this
piece as long as any man, whosoever he be, having no better
provision, and furniture of men and victuals than I have:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
wherein your Grace shall well perceive that I will not fail
to do the duty of a faithful subject and Captain, although
the enemy attempt never so stoutly; according to the trust
reposed in me.</p>

<p>I addressed letters presently to the King's Majesty by this
bearer, most humbly desiring aid from him; according to the
effect aforesaid.</p>

<p>I might now very evil[ly] have spared this bringer, my
servant and trusty Officer here, in this time of service.
Howbeit considering the great importance of his message, I
thought him a meet man for the purpose; desiring your
Majesty to credit him fully, and to hear him at large, even as
directly as your Grace would hear me to open my mind in
this complaint of imminent danger.</p>

<p>Thus trusting for relief and comfort forthwith from your
Majesty for the safeguard of Calais, and your other pieces
here; I take my leave most humbly of your Grace.</p>

<p>At your Highness's Castle of Guisnes, most assured English

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Sir William Drury</span>, now [<i>in 1579</i>] Lord Justice
of Ireland, was so inclined to martial affairs, that,
when foreign wars were ended, he sought entertainment
at Guisnes, and those parts; which had
war with the French, for King <span class="smcap">Phillip</span>'s Quarrel.
And he, having charge, and a lusty Band of Horsemen, did
many things that merit good liking.</p>

<p>For at that time, [there] was much ado: a Band [<i>regiment</i>]
of horsemen, very well appointed and full of gentlemen, was
sent from [Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Cheney</span>, K.G.] the Lord Warden [of
the Cinque Ports], an honourable and a worthy gentleman,
most full of nobleness; the Lord <span class="smcap">Cheney</span>'s father, now living.
In this band, and belonging to that charge, were sundry of the
<span class="smcap">Keyes</span>, gentlemen of good service: Master <span class="smcap">Crippes</span> having
the leading of all that company. There were sent, in like
sort, from the Prince [<i>Sovereign, i.e., Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>]: Master
<span class="smcap">William Herbert</span>'s (of St. Gillian) brother, called Master
<span class="smcap">George Herbert</span>, with a Band of footmen; and one Captain
<span class="smcap">Borne</span>, whose Lieutenant I was, at the siege of Guisnes.</p>

<p>These bands, a good season before Calais and Guisnes
were taken, joining with other bands of Calais, did make
divers journeys into Bollinnoyes [<i>the Boullognois, or district</i>
<i>round Boulogne</i>]; and sped very well: Sir <span class="smcap">William Drury</span>,
at every service, deserved no little praise; and one Captain
<span class="smcap">Winnibank</span>, an ancient soldier, was oftentimes so forward,
that he was once run through with a lance. Many Gentlemen
in those services did well and worthily: and sundry
times the Lord Warden's Band was to be praised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>And, at length, a voyage was made, by the consent and
whole power of Calais and Guisnes, to fetch a prey from
Boulogne gates; Monsieur <span class="smcap">Snarpoule</span> [<i>?<span class="smcap">Senarpont</span></i>] then
being Governor of Boulogne: but we could not handle the
matter so privily, but the French, by espial, had gotten
word thereof. Notwithstanding, as soldiers commonly
go forward with their device, so we marched secretly all
the whole night to come to our proposed enterprise: with
our footmen, whereof Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Palmer</span>, a man of great
experience, had the leading. He remained, with the whole
power of [the] footmen, near the Black Neasts, as a stale
[<i>decoy</i>] to annoy the enemy, and succour for such as
were driven in, if any such occasion came. So the Horse
Bands [<i>troops</i>] brake into the country, and pressed near
Boulogne; where there was a great number of gallant
soldiers to receive them: but our horsemen, making small
account of the matter, began to prey [upon] the country, and
drive a booty from the face of the enemy. The French
horsemen, taking their advantage, offered a skirmish, to
detract time, till better opportunity served to give a charge.
This courageous bickering grew so hot, that the French
bands began to show; and our men must abide a shock, or
retire hardily with some foil: whereupon the chiefest of our
horsemen charged those of the French that were nearest
danger; by which attempt, the French stayed a while. But,
upon small pause, they charged our men again, and overthrew
of the "Black Lances" a thirty: carrying away with
them into Boulogne, eighteen gentlemen, prisoners. This
skirmish began at seven o'clock in the morning; and lasted,
in very great service, till a leven [<i>eleven</i>]. From this overthrow,
came divers soldiers, sore wounded, to our Foot bands
[<i>companies</i>]; whose heaviness made the valiant sort pluck up
their hearts, and seek a revenge.</p>

<p>Then, albeit, that Foot Captains and gentlemen seldom
leave their Bands, and venture beyond their charge (a rule to
be much regarded!), yet the stoutest Captains and gentlemen
found means to horse themselves on cart horses and victuallers'
nags: and put certain scarfs, in manner of guidons
[<i>standards</i>] on staves' [<i>spears'</i>] ends; showing those guidons
under a hill in several sorts, sometimes appearing with
twenty men, sometimes with fifty. And, last of all, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
show of all our number, which was not fifty; and so, with a
courageous cry, set upon the enemy (leaving some of these
devised guidons behind on the hill top), and charged them
with such a fury that they left their booty, and stood to their
defence: but, in fine, were forced to retire, for by the little
stay we held the enemy in, our footmen had leisure to march;
the sound of whose drums gave no great courage to the
French. For they thereon, gave back, and left some of their
best soldiers behind them; whom we brought to Guisnes:
driving the prey before us, that was gotten in the morning,
lost in a skirmish, and recovered again at noon. At this
service, were Sir <span class="smcap">William Drury</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> of
Newnham Bridge, Captain <span class="smcap">Crippes</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Keyes</span>, and
three of his brethren, Captain <span class="smcap">George Herbert</span>, and
sundry others, in like manner, that merit good respect.</p>

<p>Our power met many times together; and did much hurt
in the Boullognois. We besieged Fines Castle, and wan it:
and Blossling Church, and overthrew it; and killed all the
men that we found therein, because Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Palmer</span> was
there hurt through the arm, with a shot. [<i>A very sorry reason!</i>]</p>

<p>A long season, our fortune was good; till, at length, by
some oversight or mishap (Let the blame fall where it ought!)
we lost Calais and Guisnes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But a little, I pray you! give me leave to touch truly the
Siege of Guisnes: not because I had some charge there; but
because sundry reports hath been raised thereof, by those
that never thoroughly knew or understood the matter.</p>

<p>The very truth is, after Calais was won, and that all hope
was taken from us of any succour out of England, our
General, the honourable Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span> [of Wilton], that is dead
[<i>he died in 1562</i>], and Master <span class="smcap">Lewis Dive</span> [<i>p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a></i>], his Lieutenant,
Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Palmer</span>, and all the Captains of Guisnes,
determined to abide the worst that Fortune or the French
could do.</p>

<p>And the day [<i>13th of January, 1558</i>] of the first approach
the enemy made, we offered a hot and stout skirmish; but
being driven in by an over great power, though our whole
people were 1,300 men, and kept the Town awhile. But
considering the Castle to be strongest, and doubting [<i>fearing</i>]
that by a Cambozade or sudden assault, the town might be
won, for it was but weak; we retired our whole power into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the Castle: and so manned the base Court, the Braies, and
Bulwarks, the Keep, the Catte, the Heart of the Castle, and
all that was necessary, with double men.</p>

<p>At the present siege, there came out of Flanders, fifty
valiant Spaniards; and a band of Burgundians, Monsieur
<span class="smcap">Dieffkie</span>, being their Captain. Monsieur <span class="smcap">Mount Dragon</span>
was leader of the Spaniards: who were placed in the Braies;
where Captain <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> had some shot [<i>harquebussiers</i>] to
succour them.</p>

<p>The Burgundians were placed in Mary Bulwark; with
Captain <span class="smcap">Borne</span>'s Band, whose Lieutenant I was. Against
this Bulwark, which was thought impregnable, the [Frenchmen's]
great battery was planted: albeit, three or four days
[<i>15th-18th January, see pp. <a href="#Page_180">180</a>-<a href="#Page_81">81</a></i>] were spent (we held the
enemy such play), before the battery was planted.</p>

<p>One day, we issued [forth], and set upon Monsieur [<i>i.e., the</i>
<i>Duke</i>] <span class="smcap">De Guise</span>, as he was in a place called Mill Field,
viewing the ground; and had taken him, had he not left his
cloak behind him: of the which white cloak, one of our
Gentlemen had hold of. And though he was succoured, we
brought away some of his company: and retired with little
loss or none at all. [Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>], the Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span> that now
is [1579], was at the hard escape of Monsieur <span class="smcap">De Guise</span>.</p>

<p>We set upon a great troop of horsemen, not long before
this, that came from the spoil of Calais; and took numbers
of them. I had, for my part, a couple of fair horses and a
prisoner. At both these services, were old Captain <span class="smcap">Andrea</span>,
Captain <span class="smcap">John Savage</span>, and a sufficient number of lusty soldiers.</p>

<p>We made divers sallies, but that prevailed not. For the
battery went off, and many other great cannons did beat at
the high towers; the stones whereof did marvellously annoy
us: and the shot was so great; and the enemy had gotten
such great advantage of ground, that we could not walk, nor
go safely any way within the Castle. For our General and
Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Palmer</span> sitting on a form, devising for our commodity,
were in such danger, that a cannon shot took
away the form, and brake Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Palmer</span>'s leg; of which
hurt, he died in Paris after. And a great shot took off
Master <span class="smcap">Wake</span>'s head, as he was sleeping under a great tree.
So sundry, that thought themselves safe, were so dribbed at
with cannon shot, that they never knew who did hurt them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the time drew on, after the breach was made, we
must defend the assault that was given to Mary Bulwark;
which stood out[side] of the Castle, and far from succour of
any: because the gate was rammed up; and we could not
pass into the Castle but by the way, first, along the Braies,
and then, between two gates. Which way, the enemy had
espied: and placed many great shot, full upon that passage.</p>

<p>Now [<i>i.e., 18th January, 1558</i>] Monsieur <span class="smcap">Diffkie</span>, Captain
<span class="smcap">Borne</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">Oswold Lambert</span> [<i>with their companies</i>], and
the fifty Spaniards, [<i>to the number in all of about 450 men</i>] were
forced to abide the assault; which began at eleven o'clock,
and lasted till night. <span class="smcap">Mount Dragon</span> came into Mary Bulwark,
and three gentlemen more; and stood stoutly to our
defence: two of whom were slain. My Captain's head was
smitten off with a cannon's shot: and unto our Band were left
no more but one Master <span class="smcap">Holford</span> and I, to guide the whole
company. And Captain <span class="smcap">Diffkie</span> was wounded to the death,
whose Band fought manfully in the revenge of their Captain.
The old Captain <span class="smcap">Andrea</span>, covetous of fame, was desirous
to have our fellowship: but he had no Band [<i>company</i>] nor
people to do us pleasure. Captain <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> was crossed
[<i>struck</i>] with a great shot; and mine armour, with the breaking
of a great piece, was stricken flat upon my body; but [it]
being unbraced, I might continue the service. Which
service, in mine opinion, was so terribly handled by the
French (Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Andelot</span> being the leader of the
assault), that both Englishman, Burgundian, and Spaniard,
at that Bulwark, had enough to do to keep the enemy out:
and, as I believe, at this assault, we lost 150 good soldiers.</p>

<p>But the night coming on, the French surceased their fury,
and yet kept themselves closely, under the top of the breach,
where our shot nor flankers could do them no harm: for all
our great ordnance was dismounted, long before the enemy
made any approach for the giving of an assault.</p>

<p>The next day [<i>the 19th of January</i>], within three half hours,
the battery had beaten the breach so bare (it moulded away,
like a hillock of sand) that we [<i>reduced now to about 300 men</i>]
were forced to fight on our knees. Having been kept waking
all the night before, with false allarummes [<i>alarms</i>]; our men
began to faint, and wax weary of working at the breach: but
we defended Mary Bulwark so well all that dangerous day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that the French lost 1,000 soldiers, by their own confession, at
the same service; and yet the assault endured to the very
dark night, with as much cruelty as could be devised. And
always when the enemy's first men did wax feeble with
labour; there was a second and new relief of fresh bands to
continue the assault: so that, as long as the daylight served,
it seemed by the fight, a bloody broil hath no end, nor season
to take breath in; which certainly would have daunted any
heart living.</p>

<p>The next night, was so plied with politic practices, that we
had scarcely leisure to take any rest or sustentation. And,
indeed, with overwatching, some of our men fell asleep "in the
middle of the tale" and time of greatest necessity to debate
and argue of those things that pertained to life and liberty,
and to avoid utter servitude and shame [<i>i.e., they slept in the</i>
<i>course of the fight</i>].</p>

<p>And now we, that were without the Castle, might hear
great business and stir throughout the whole body and heart
of the piece [<i>fortress</i>].</p>

<p>For, the next morning [<i>20th of January, 1558</i>], which was
the third day we were assaulted, our General looked for a
general assault, and to be roundly assailed: as, of troth, he
was. In the meanwhile, we might speak one to another afar
off, and our friends answered us over the wall; for nearer
together, we might not come: and for succour or aid to our
soldiers in Mary Bulwark, we hoped not after. Every man
was occupied with his own business and charge; that no one
person might be spared from his place.</p>

<p>Well, as GOD would permit, the poor Spaniards [in the
Braie] and such Burgundians as were left alive in Mary
Bulwark, fell to make a counterscarf, to beat out the enemy
from the Braie, when the Bulwark should be won: as it was
likely to be lost, the breach was so bare, and the entry for
the enemy was so large; for, in a manner, they might assault
our Bulwark round about, on all sides. And they did lodge
at the very edge of the breach, to the number of 2,000, of their
bravest Bands: minding to assail us, as soon as the day
began to peep out of the skies.</p>

<p>Which they performed, when the third day approached.
For a general assault was given to every place of the Castle:
which assault endured till the very night came on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
French, in this assault, wan the Base Court; and were
ready to set fire under the gate, and blow it up with powder.</p>

<p>Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Andelot</span>, in his own person, with 2,000
soldiers, entered the Mary Bulwark; who slew the Spaniards
in the Braie: and forced, as many Burgundians and English
as were left alive, which were but 15 (Captain <span class="smcap">Andrea</span>,
Captain <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, and <span class="smcap">MYSELF</span>; with twelve common soldiers)
out of 400, to leap down into the dykes, and so to scramble
for their lives; and creep into a hole of a brick wall that my
Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span> had broken out to receive such as escaped from
the assault. But when we had entered the hole in the wall,
the French followed at our heels; and we, to save our lives,
turned again, bending pikes against the passage, and so shot
off one hargaboze [<i>harquibus</i>]: by which means, the enemy
followed no further.</p>

<p>And yet we were in as great distress as before. For we
were between two gates: and at the gate we should have
entered, were two great cannon, ready charged to be shot
off, to drive them back that would have set fire on the gate.
And the cry and noise was so great and terrible, on all sides,
that we could not be heard to speak. But, as GOD would,
Master <span class="smcap">Lewis Dive</span> [<i>p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a></i>] (now, a man of worship in Bedfordshire)
heard my voice. Then I plied the matter so sore,
for life: so that, with much ado, Master <span class="smcap">Dive</span> received us
into the heart of the Castle. And yet, in the opening of the
gate, the French were like to enter pelley melley [<i>pell mell</i>]
with us, if a cannon shot had not made place, whiles the gate
was a shutting.</p>

<p>But now, we were no sooner come before my Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>:
but all the soldiers cried, "Yield up the Castle, upon some
reasonable composition!" And when the soldiers saw they
could not have the Castle yielded; they threatened "to fling
my Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span> over the walls": and that was determined;
if my Lord had not prevented [<i>forestalled</i>] them with a policy.
Whereupon the Captains were called together; and there,
they agreed to send me to Monsieur <span class="smcap">De Guise</span>, with an
offer, that "If we might all march, with bag and baggage,
ensign displayed, and six pieces of ordnance: we would yield
the Castle into the hands of the French."</p>

<p>Now it was night, and I must be let out at Master <span class="smcap">Harry</span>
<span class="smcap">Norwitch</span> his Bulwark; but neither Drum nor Trumpet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
went with me: because a Trumpeter was slain as he sounded
to have a parley; and, as I heard say, a Drum[mer] that
would have followed me, was shot in the leg. But there was
no remedy. I must wade over the water, in which there lay
certain galthroppes, as they term them, which were great
boards, full of long spikes of iron; on the which, having good
boots and a stay in my hand, I was taught daintily to tread:
and the night was so dark, that the enemy might not take any
good mark of me, albeit they shot divers times.</p>

<p>So, with some hazard, and no great hope to attain that I was
sent for, I was taken by the watch; and brought to Monsieur
<span class="smcap">De Guise</span>'s tent, where the Duke <span class="smcap">D'Aumale</span> and many great
Estates were in presence.</p>

<p>My message being said, with due reverence made: the
Duke told me, that "all our ordnance was dismounted, and
that thereby our malice was cut off; and we could not do
his camp any annoyance. Wherefore," said he, "this was a
stout brag, to seek a capitulation with such advantage upon."</p>

<p>I replied to his Excellency, and told, "We had flankers
[<i>guns with a cross fire</i>] and other great pieces, which would
not be discovered till the next assault:" declaring likewise,
"Our soldiers had sworn rather to die in their [own] defence,
than not to march away, like men of war."</p>

<p>The noblemen, on this mine answer, bade me "Return!
and with the rest of the Castle, to do the worst they could!"</p>

<p>So I departed, and the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> beholding, as he
thought, we were resolved to see the uttermost of fortune;
called me back again: and fell to questions and arguments
with me, such as I liked not [<i>i.e., he tried to bribe <span class="smcap">Churchyard</span></i>
<i>in some way</i>]; but other answer did I not make, than
you have heard before. Wherewith, he called for some meat;
and made me to sit down.</p>

<p>After I had a little refreshed myself, I demanded to know
his pleasure.</p>

<p>Who straightways told me, "There was no help to be had;
but to become all captives and prisoners to the French King."</p>

<p>"Not so, Sir," I answered; "and that should the next
assault make trial of."</p>

<p>Then, he went to talk with the Noblemen; and there, they
concluded, "That the soldiers should march away with bag
and baggage: and the Captains and Officers should remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
prisoners:" which I knew would not be liked: and so
desired to be sent to my Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>.</p>

<p>But when I came into the Castle, and the soldiers had
gotten word that they might march away at their will: they
came to me, and threatened me with great words, commanding
me, "To make despatch, and yield up the fort!" For
they said, "Since the matter is in talk, and likely to be
brought to a good purpose; they would cut my throat, if I
made not, hastily, an end of the case." And thereupon had
they made a great hole in a wall; and so they thrust me out
among the Almains, who rudely handled me.</p>

<p>But my Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, at my departure, bade me tell the
Duke, that the Almains were about to break into the Castle,
and to set the gate afire: and my Lord said, "He would
shoot off his great ordnance among them; if the Law of
Arms were not better observed!"</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, at another place was entered Monsieur
<span class="smcap">De Tre</span> [<span class="smcap"><i>D'Estrees</i></span>] Master of the [French] Ordnance;
and [Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>] the Lord <span class="smcap">Grey</span> that now is, was sent to
the Camp, for the pawn [<i>security</i>] of Monsieur <span class="smcap">D'Estrees</span>.</p>

<p>But I was come to Monsieur <span class="smcap">De Guise</span> before those
things were finished: and had told him my message. And
he, like a noble Prince and faithful Captain, rode to the gate
(causing me to mount behind Master <span class="smcap">Harry Dudley</span>);
where the Almains were busily occupied about some naughty
practice: and, with a great truncheon, he stroke divers of
the Almains and others, to make them retire; and laying a
load [<i>i.e., of blows</i>] about him, he made such way, that the
gate was free, and the capitulation was, at leisure, talked of.</p>

<p>But I was not suffered to enter any more into the Castle;
and so stayed as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, look what promise Monsieur <span class="smcap">De Guise</span>
made, it was so well kept and observed that our soldiers
marched away, with all their wealth, money, and weapons.
And great wealth was borne by them from Guisnes: insomuch
that divers poor soldiers were made thereby, for all
[the] days of their life after. And this is to be noted. There
was great honour in the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>. For the Bands
[<i>originally 1,300 p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>; but now about 500, having lost 800, see</i>
<i>below</i>] that parted [<i>departed</i>] (either sick or sound, hurt or
whole) were honestly conveyed, and truly dealt withal; even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
as long as they were in any danger, albeit they had great
sums of money and treasure with them: and the General
with his Captains and Officers were courteously used, so long
as they were in the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> his camp.</p>

<p>And, to say the truth, I think our peace was not so
dishonourable, as some report. For</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Succour, had we no hope of.</p>

<p>The next assault had overthrown us.</p>

<p>The whole members [<i>i.e., the external fortifications</i>] of the
Castle were cut off from us.</p>

<p>There remained but the bare body of the Castle in our
custody.</p>

<p>The enemy's cannons did beat us from the breach <i>on</i>
<i>the inside</i>.</p>

<p>The Castle was subject to every shot; both from the
Keep, the Catte, and the Mary Bulwark.</p>

<p>The French possessed all the special places of our
strength and comfort.</p>

<p>The best and chiefest of our soldiers were slain, or lay
maimed in most miserable state.</p>

<p>And we had lost 800 men in these assaults and services;
which did their duty so well, that the enemy confessed
that they had lost 4,000, before we could be
brought to any <i>parley</i> or composition.</p></div>

<p>But some of our Officers [<i>? Is our Author here alluding to</i>
<i>Captain Lord <span class="smcap">Dudley</span> at Hammes, p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a></i>], by craft and cunning,
escaped homewards out of the Frenchmen's hands; came to
Court, and made up their Bands [<i>companies</i>] again; to the
great reproach of those that meant no such matters. So, by
that subtilty and shift, they that escaped got a pay or some
reward of the Prince: and those that abode out the brunt
and hazard of the bloody broil, were left in prison.</p>

<p>And the world thought, by seeing so many come home, we
had lost but a few at the siege of Guisnes; which is otherwise
to be proved and affirmed for a truth; when true trial
[<i>inquiry</i>] shall be made.</p>

<p>Calais was lost before, I cannot declare how. But well
I wot, Sir <span class="smcap">Anthony Ager</span>, a stout gentleman, and a valiant
Knight, there lost his life: and one Captain <span class="smcap">Saule</span> was terribly
burnt with powder, in making a train to destroy the enemy
[<i>p. <a href="#Page_199">199</a></i>].</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Now</span> then after these so great afflictions falling upon
this realm from the first beginning of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s
reign, wherein so many men, women, and children
were burned; many imprisoned, and in prisons
starved, divers exiled, some spoiled of goods and
possessions, a great number driven from house and home, so
many weeping eyes, so many sobbing hearts, so many children
made fatherless, so many fathers bereft of their wives and
children, so many vexed in conscience, and divers against
conscience constrained to recant, and, in conclusion, never a
good man in all the realm but suffered something during all
the time of this bloody persecution. After all this, I say,
now we are come at length, the LORD be praised! to the
17th day of November, which day, as it brought to the persecuted
members of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> rest from their careful mourning,
so it easeth me somewhat likewise of my laborious writing;
by the death, I mean, of Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Who, being long
sick before, upon the said 17th day of November, 1558, about
three or four a clock in the morning, yielded her life to nature,
and her kingdom to Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, her sister.</p>

<p>As touching the manner of whose death, some say that she
died of a tympany [<i>dropsy</i>]; some, by her much sighing
before her death, supposed she died of thought and sorrow.
Whereupon her Council seeing her sighing, and desirous to
know the cause, to the end they might minister the more
ready consolation unto her, feared, as they said, that "She
took that thought for the King's Majesty her husband, which
was gone from her."</p>

<p>To whom she answering again, "Indeed," said she, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
may be one cause; but that is not the greatest wound that
pierceth my oppressed mind!" but what that was, she would
not express to them.</p>

<p>Albeit, afterwards, she opened the matter more plainly to
Master <span class="smcap">Ryse</span> and Mistress <span class="smcap">Clarentius</span> [<i>p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a></i>] (if it be true
that they told me, which heard it of Master <span class="smcap">Ryse</span> himself);
who (then being most familiar with her, and most bold about
her) told her that "They feared she took thought for King
<span class="smcap">Philip</span>'s departing from her."</p>

<p>"Not that only," said she, "but when I am dead and
opened; you shall find Calais lying in my heart," &amp;c.</p>

that shall succeed her, to be noted, that before her, never was

<p>Here we see the Londoners in a kind of delirium of joy. The horrid
nightmare of the burnings, of national loss and dishonour at Calais, &amp;c.,
had passed away. Men could now breathe freely, and look forward to
better times.]</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/219v.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Vpon</span> Saturday, which was the 14th day of
January, in the year of our Lord God,
1558 [<i>i.e., 1559</i>], about two of the clock, at
after noon, the most noble and Christian
Princess, our most dread Sovereign Lady,
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, by the grace of GOD, Queen
of England, France, and Ireland, Defender
of the Faith, &amp;c., marched from the Tower,
to pass through the City of London, towards Westminster:
richly furnished, and most honourably accompanied, as well
with Gentlemen, Barons, and other the Nobility of this realm,
as also with a noble train of goodly and beautiful Ladies,
richly appointed.</p>

<p>And entering the City, was of the people received marvellous
entirely, as appeared by the assembly's prayers, wishes,
welcomings, cries, tender words, and all other signs: which
argue a wonderful earnest love of most obedient subjects
towards their Sovereign. And, on the other side, Her Grace,
by holding up her hands, and merry countenance to such as
stood afar off, and most tender and gentle language to those
that stood nigh to Her Grace, did declare herself no less
thankfully to receive her people's good will, than they lovingly
offered it unto her.</p>

<p>To all that "wished Her Grace well!" she gave "Hearty
thanks!" and to such as bade "GOD save Her Grace!" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
said again, "GOD save them all!" and thanked with all
her heart. So that, on either side, there was nothing but
gladness! nothing but prayer! nothing but comfort!</p>

<p>The Queen's Majesty rejoiced marvellously to see that so
exceedingly shewed towards Her Grace, which all good Princes
have ever desired; I mean, so earnest Love of Subjects, so
evidently declared even to Her Grace's own person, being
carried in the midst of them. The people, again, were wonderfully
ravished with the loving answers and gestures of
their Princess; like to the which, they had before tried, at her
first coming to the town, from Hatfield. This Her Grace's
loving behaviour preconceived in the people's heads, upon
these considerations, was then thoroughly confirmed; and
indeed implanted a wonderful hope in them touching her
worthy government in the rest of her reign.</p>

<p>For in all her Passage, she did not only shew her most
gracious love towards the people in general; but also
privately, if the baser personages had either offered Her
Grace any flowers or such like, as a signification of their
good will; or moved to her any suit, she most gently (to the
common rejoicings of all lookers on, and private comfort of
the party) stayed her chariot, and heard their requests. So
that, if a man should say well, he could not better term the
City of London that time, than a Stage wherein was shewed
the wonderful Spectacle of a noble hearted Princess towards
her most loving people; and the people's exceeding comfort
in beholding so worthy a Sovereign, and hearing so prince-like
a voice; which could not but have set the enemy on fire,
(since the virtue is in the enemy always commended) much
more could not but inflame her natural, obedient, and most
loving people; whose weal leaneth only upon her Grace, and
her government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, therefore, the Queen's Majesty passed from the
Tower [<i>see as to her former dismal visit in March, 1554, at p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a></i>],
till she came to Fanchurch [<i>Fenchurch</i>]: the people on each
side, joyously beholding the view of so gracious a Lady, their
Queen; and Her Grace no less gladly noting, and observing
the same.</p>

<p>Near unto Fanchurch, was erected a scaffold richly furnished;
whereon stood a noise of instruments; and a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in costly apparel, which was appointed to welcome the Queen's
Majesty, in the whole City's behalf.</p>

<p>Against which place, when Her Grace came, of her own
will she commanded the chariot to be stayed; and that the
noise might be appeased, till the child had uttered his welcoming
Oration, which he spake in English metre, as here
followeth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O peerless Sovereign Queen! Behold, what this thy town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath thee presented with, at thy First Entrance here!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Second is True Hearts! which love thee from their root!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose Suit is Triumph now, and ruleth all the game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Faithfulness has won, and all untruth driven out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which skip for joy, when as they hear thy happy name!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Welcome, therefore, O Queen! as much as heart can think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome again, O Queen! as much as tongue can tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome to joyous Tongues, and Hearts that will not shrink!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"GOD, thee preserve!" we pray; and wish thee ever well!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At which words of the last line, the people gave a great
shout; wishing, with one assent, as the child had said.</p>

<p>And the Queen's Majesty thanked most heartily, both the
City for this her gentle receiving at the first, and also the
people for confirming the same.</p>

<p>Here was noted in the Queen's Majesty's countenance,
during the time that the child spake, besides a perpetual attentiveness
in her face, a marvellous change in look, as the
child's words touched either her person, or the people's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Tongues and Hearts: so that she, with rejoicing visage, did
evidently declare that the words took no less place in her
mind, than they were most heartily pronounced by the child,
as from all the hearts of her most hearty citizens.</p>

<p>The same Verses were fastened up in a table [<i>painted board.</i>
<i>Table is the Elizabethan word for picture</i>] upon the scaffold;
and the Latin thereof likewise, in Latin verses, in another
table, as hereafter ensueth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Urbs tua qu&aelig; ingressu dederit tibi munera primo,</i><br /></span>

<p>Now when the child had pronounced his oration, and the
Queen's Highness so thankfully received it; she marched
forward towards Gracious [<i>Gracechurch</i>] Street, where, at the
upper end, before the sign of the <i>Eagle</i>, the city had erected
a gorgeous and sumptuous Ark, as here followeth.</p>

<p>A Stage was made which extended from one side of the
street to the other, richly vawted [<i>vaulted</i>] with battlements,
containing three ports [<i>gates</i>]; and over the middlemost was
advanced three several stages, in degrees [<i>tiers</i>]. Upon the
lowest stage, was made one seat royal; wherein were placed
two personages representing King <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span>, and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
his wife, daughter of King <span class="smcap">Edward IV.</span> Both of these
two Princes sitting under one Cloth of Estate, in their seats;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
no otherwise divided, but that th[e] one of them, which was
King <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span>, proceeding out of the House of <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>,
was enclosed in a red rose; and the other, which was Queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, being heir to the House of <span class="smcap">York</span>, enclosed with
a white rose: each of them royally crowned and decently apparelled,
as pertaineth to Princes, with sceptres in their hands,
and one vawt [<i>vault</i>] surmounting their heads, wherein aptly
were placed two tables, each containing the title, of those two
Princes. And these personages were so set, that the one of
them joined hands with the other, with the ring of matrimony
perceived on the finger.</p>

<p>Out of the which two roses sprang two branches gathered
into one: which were directed upward to the second stage or
degree; wherein was placed one representing the valiant and
noble Prince, <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>, who sprang out of the former
stock, crowned with a crown imperial. And by him sate
one representing the right worthy Lady, Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span>; wife
to the said <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>, and mother to our most sovereign
Lady, Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> that now is. Both apparelled with
sceptres and diadems, and other furniture due to the estate of
a King and Queen: and two tables surmounting their heads,
wherein were written their names and titles.</p>

<p>From their seat also, proceeded upwards one branch directed
to the third and uppermost stage or degree, wherein likewise
was planted a seat royal; in the which was set one representing
the Queen's most excellent Majesty, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, now
our most dread Sovereign Lady, crowned and apparelled as
the other Princes were.</p>

<p>Out of the forepart of this pageant was made a standing
for a child, which, at the Queen's Majesty's coming, declared
unto her the whole meaning of the said pageant.</p>

<p>The two sides of the same were filled with loud noises of music.</p>

<p>And all empty places thereof, were furnished with sentences
concerning Unity. And the whole pageant was garnished
with red and white roses; and in the forefront of the same
pageant, in a fair wreath, was written the name and title of
the same, which was</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">THE UNITING OF THE TWO
HOUSES OF YORK AND LANCASTER.</em>
</p>

<p>This pageant was grounded upon the Queen Majesty's name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
For like as the long war between the two Houses of <span class="smcap">York</span>
and <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span> then ended, when <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, daughter of
<span class="smcap">Edward IV.</span>, matched in marriage with <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span>, heir
to the House of <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>; so since that the Queen's
Majesty's name was <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and forasmuch as she is the
only heir of <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>, which came of both Houses as the
knitting up of concord: it was devised that like as <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
was the first occasion of concord; so She, another
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, might maintain the same among her subjects.
So that Unity was the end, whereat the whole device shot; as
the Queen's Majesty's name moved the first ground.</p>

<p>This pageant now against the Queen's Majesty's coming,
was addressed [<i>set forth</i>] with children representing the forenamed
personages; with all furniture due unto the setting
forth of such a well-meant matter, as the argument declared,
costly and sumptuously set forth, as the beholders can witness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, the Queen's Majesty drew near unto the said pageant,
and forasmuch as the noise was great, by reason of the press
of people, so that she could scarce hear the child which did
interpret the said pageant; and her chariot was passed so
far forward that she could not well view the personages representing
the Kings and Queens above named; she required
to have the matter opened unto her, and what they signified,
with the End of Unity, and Ground of her Name, according as
is before expressed.</p>

<p>For the sight whereof, Her Grace caused her chariot to
be removed back; and yet hardly could she see, because the
children were set somewhat with the farthest in.</p>

<p>But after that Her Grace understood the meaning thereof,
she thanked the City, praised the fairness of the work, and
promised that "She would do her whole endeavour for the
continual preservation of concord!" as the pageant did import.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The child appointed in the standing above named, to open
the meaning of the said pageant, spake these words unto Her
Grace.</p>

<p>These Verses and other pretty Sentences were drawn in
void places of this pageant, all tending to one end, that quietness
might be maintained and all dissention displaced: and
that by the Queen's Majesty, Heir to Agreement, and agreeing
in name with her which tofore had joined those Houses,
which had been the occasion of much debate and Civil War
with this realm (as may appear to such as well search
Chronicles; but be not to be touched in this Treatise, only
declaring Her Grace's Passage through the City, and what
provision the City made therefore).</p>

<p>And ere the Queen's Majesty came within hearing of this
pageant, as also at all the other pageants; she sent certain to
require the people to be silent, for Her Majesty was disposed
to hear all that should be said unto her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Queen's Majesty had heard the child's oration
and understood the meaning of the pageant at large; she
marched forward towards Cornhill, always received with like
rejoicing of the people.</p>

<p>And there, as Her Grace passed by the Conduit, which was
curiously trimmed against that time, adorned with rich
banners, and a noise of loud instruments upon the top thereof:
she espied the second pageant. And because she feared, for
the people's noise, that she should not hear the child which
did expound the same, she inquired what that pageant was,
ere that she came to it. And there understood, that there
was a child representing Her Majesty's person, placed in a
Seat of Government, supported by certain Virtues which suppressed
their contrary Vices under their feet: and so forth,
as, in the description of the said pageant, shall hereafter
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>This pageant, standing in the nether end of Cornhill, was
extended from one side of the street to the other; and, in the
same pageant was devised three gates, all open: and over the
middle part thereof was erected one Chair or Seat royal, with
Cloth of Estate to the same appertaining, wherein was placed
a child representing the Queen's Highness, with consideration
had for place convenient for a table, which contained her
name and title.</p>

<p>And in a comely wreath, artificially and well devised, with
perfect sight and understanding to the people, in the front of
the same pageant, was written the name and title thereof
which is</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">THE SEAT OF WORTHY GOVERNANCE.</em>
</p>

<p>Which Seat was made in such artificial manner, as to the
appearance of the lookers on, the forepart seemed to have no
stay; and therefore, of force, was stayed by lively [<i>living</i>]
personages. Which personages were in number four, standing
and staying the forefront of the same Seat royal, each
having his face to the Queen and the people; whereof every
one had a table to express their effects. Which are Virtues,
namely, <span class="smcap">Pure Religion</span>, <span class="smcap">Love of Subjects</span>, <span class="smcap">Wisdom</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Justice</span>; which did tread their contrary Vices under their
feet: that is to wit, <span class="smcap">Pure Religion</span> did tread upon <span class="smcap">Ignorance</span>
and <span class="smcap">Superstition</span>, <span class="smcap">Love of Subjects</span> did tread upon
<span class="smcap">Rebellion</span> and <span class="smcap">Insolency</span>, <span class="smcap">Wisdom</span> did tread upon <span class="smcap">Folly</span>
and <span class="smcap">Vainglory</span>, <span class="smcap">Justice</span> did tread upon <span class="smcap">Adulation</span> and
<span class="smcap">Bribery</span>. Each of these personages, according to their
proper names and properties, had not only their names in
plain and perfect writing set upon their breasts, easily to be
read of all: but also every of them was aptly and properly
apparelled; so that his apparel and name did agree to
express the same person, that in title he represented. This
part of the pageant was thus appointed and furnished.</p>

<p>The two sides over the two side ports had in them placed
a noise of instruments [<i>i.e., a band of players</i>]; which, immediately
after the child's speech, gave a heavenly melody.</p>

<p>Upon the top or uppermost part of the said pageant stood
the Arms of England, royally portraitured; with the proper
beasts to uphold the same. One representing the Queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Highness sat in this Seat, crowned with an imperial crown:
and before her seat was a convenient place appointed for one
child, which did interpret and apply the said pageant as
hereafter shall be declared.</p>

<p>Every void place was furnished with proper Sentences
commending the Seat supported by the Virtues; and defacing
the Vices, to the utter extirpation of rebellion, and to everlasting
continuance of quietness and peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Queen's Majesty approaching nigh unto this pageant,
thus beautified and furnished in all points, caused her
chariot to be drawn nigh thereunto, that Her Grace might
hear the child's oration, which was this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While that Religion True shall Ignorance suppress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with her weighty foot, break Superstition's head;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with Zeal to the Prince, Insolency down tread;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While Justice can Flattering tongues and Bribery deface;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Folly and Vainglory, to Wisdom yield their hands:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But Wrong decayeth still, and Righteousness upstands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now all thy subjects' hearts, O Prince of peerless fame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do trust these virtues shall maintain up thy throne!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Vice be kept down still, the wicked put to shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That good with good may joy, and naught with naught may moan!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which Verses were painted upon the right side of the
same pageant; and in Latin thereof, on the left side, in
another table, which were these.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2"><i>Stultitia, atque hujus numen inanis honor.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beside these Verses, there were placed in every void room
of the pageant, both in English and Latin, such Sentences
as advanced the Seat of Governance up-holden by Virtue.</p>

<p>The ground of this pageant was that, like as by Virtues
(which do abundantly appear in Her Grace), the Queen's
Majesty was established in the Seat of Government; so she
should sit fast in the same, so long as she embraced Virtue,
and held Vice under foot. For if Vice once got up the head,
it would put the Seat of Government in peril of falling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Queen's Majesty, when she had heard the child, and
understood the pageant at full, gave the City also thanks
there; and most graciously promised her good endeavour for
the maintenance of the said virtues, and suppression of vices.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so marched on, till she came against the Great
Conduit in Cheap; which was beautified with pictures and
sentences accordingly, against Her Grace's coming thither.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against Soper Lane's end was extended from the one side
of the street to the other, a pageant which had three gates,
all open.</p>

<p>Over the middlemost whereof, were erected three several
stages, whereon sat eight children, as hereafter followeth.
On the uppermost, one child; on the middle, three; on the
lowest, four; each having the proper name of the Blessing
that he did represent, written in a table, and placed above
his head.</p>

<p>In the forefront of this pageant, before the children which
did represent the Blessings, was a convenient standing cast
out for a child to stand, which did expound the said pageant
unto the Queen's Majesty; as was done in the other before.
Every of these children were appointed and apparelled
according to the Blessing, which he did represent.</p>

<p>And on the forepart of the said pageant was written, in fair
letters, the name of the said pageant, in this manner following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p class="center "><em class="gesperrt">THE EIGHT BEATITUDES, EXPRESSED
IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF THE
GOSPEL OF SAINT MATTHEW,
APPLIED TO OUR SOVEREIGN
LADY QUEEN ELIZABETH.</em>
</p>

<p>Over the two side posts was placed a noise of instruments.</p>

<p>And all void places in the pageant were furnished with
pretty Sayings commending and touching the meaning of the
said pageant; which were the Promises and Blessings of
Almighty GOD made to His people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before the Queen's Highness came into this pageant, she
required the matter somewhat to be opened unto her; that Her
Grace might the better understand what should, afterward,
by the child, be said unto her. Which was so, that the City
had there erected the pageant with eight children, representing
the Eight Blessings touched in the Fifth Chapter of
<i>St. Matthew</i>; whereof every one, upon just considerations,
was applied unto Her Highness. And that the people
thereby put Her Grace in mind, that as her good doings
before, had given just occasion why that these Blessings
might fall upon her; that so, if Her Grace did continue in
her goodness, as she had entered, she should hope for the
fruit of these Promises, due unto them that do exercise
themselves in the Blessings.</p>

<p>Which Her Grace heard marvellously graciously, and
required that the chariot might be removed towards the
pageant, that she might perceive the child's words: which
were these, the Queen's Majesty giving most attentive ear,
and requiring that the people's noise might be stayed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou hast been eight times blest! O Queen of worthy fame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Meekness in thy spirit, when care did thee beset!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Hunger and by Thirst, and justice couldst none get!<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>When these words were spoken, all the people wished that
"As the child had spoken, so GOD would strengthen Her
Grace against all her adversaries!" whom the Queen's
Majesty did most gently thank, for their so loving wish.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These Verses were painted on the left side of the said
pageant; and other, in Latin, on the other side, which were
these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Qui lugent hilares fient, qui mitia gestant</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Pectora, multa soli jugera culta metent.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Huic hominum generi terram, mare, sidera vovit</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Omnipotens, horum quisque beatus erit</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides these, every void place in the pageant was furnished
with Sentences touching the matter and ground of the
said pageant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When all that was to be said in this pageant was ended;
the Queen's Majesty passed on forward in Cheap side.</p>

<p>At the Standard in Cheap, which was dressed fair against
the time, was placed a noise of trumpets, with banners and
other furniture.</p>

<p>The Cross, likewise, was also made fair and well trimmed.
And near unto the same, upon the porch of Saint Peter's
Church door, stood the Waits of the City; which did give a
pleasant noise with their instruments, as the Queen's Majesty
did pass by. Who, on every side, cast her countenance, and
wished well to all her most loving people.</p>

<p>Soon after that Her Grace passed the Cross, she had espied
the pageant erected at the Little Conduit in Cheap; and
incontinent required to know what it might signify. And it
was told Her Grace, that there was placed <span class="smcap">Time</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Time!</span>" quoth she, "and Time hath brought me hither!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
And so forth the whole matter was opened to Her Grace, as
hereafter shall be declared in the description of the pageant.
But when in the opening, Her Grace understood that the
<i>Bible</i> in English, should be delivered unto her by <span class="smcap">Truth</span>
(which was therein represented by a child), she thanked the
City for that gift, and said that she would oftentimes read
over that book; commanding Sir <span class="smcap">John Parrat</span>, one of the
knights which held up her canopy, to go before, and to receive
it: but learning that it should be delivered unto Her
Grace, down by a silken lace, she caused him to stay.</p>

<p>And so passed forward till she came against the Aldermen,
in the high end of Cheap, tofore the Little Conduit; where
the Companies of the City ended, which began at Fanchurch
[<i>Fenchurch Street</i>] and stood along the streets, one by another,
enclosed with rails hanged with cloths, and themselves well
apparelled with many rich furs, and their Livery Hoods
upon their shoulders, in comely and seemly manner; having
before them sundry persons well apparelled in silks and
chains of gold, as Whifflers and Guarders of the said Companies:
besides a number of rich hangings (as well of
tapestry, arras, cloths of gold, silver, velvet, damask, satin,
and other silks) plentifully hanged all the way, as the
Queen's Highness passed from the Tower through the City.
Out at the windows and penthouses of every house did hang
a number of rich and costly banners and streamers, till Her
Grace came to the upper end of Cheap.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And there by appointment, the Right Worshipful Master
<span class="smcap">Ranulph Cholmeley</span>, Recorder of the City, presented to
the Queen's Majesty, a purse of crimson satin, richly
wrought with gold; wherein the City gave unto the Queen's
Majesty a thousand marks in gold [<i>= &pound;666 = about &pound;5,000</i>
<i>now</i>]; as Master Recorder did declare briefly unto the Queen's
Majesty. [<i>Compare the similar usual gift to her Mother</i>
<i>25 years before, at Vol. II. p. 48.</i>] Whose words tended to
this end, that "The Lord Mayor, his brethren and commonalty
of the City, to declare their gladness and good will towards
the Queen's Majesty, did present Her Grace with that gold;
desiring Her Grace to continue their good and gracious
Queen, and not to esteem the value of the gift, but the mind
of the givers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen's Majesty, with both her hands took the
purse, and answered to him again marvellously pithily; and
so pithily that the standers by, as they embraced entirely her
gracious answer, so they marvelled at the couching thereof:
which was in words truly reported these. "I thank my
Lord Mayor, his brethren, and you all! And whereas your
request is, that I should continue your good Lady and Queen:
be ye ensured that I will be as good unto you, as ever Queen
was to her people! No will in me can lack! neither, do I
trust, shall there lack any power! And persuade yourselves
that, for the safety and quietness of you all, I will not spare,
if need be, to shed my blood! GOD thank you all!"</p>

<p>Which answer of so noble hearted a Princess, if it moved
a marvellous shout and rejoicing, it is nothing to be marvelled
at; since both the heartiness thereof was so wonderful,
and the words so jointly knit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Her Grace had thus answered the Recorder, she
marched towards the Little Conduit; where was erected a
pageant, with square proportion, standing directly before the
same Conduit, with battlements accordingly. And in the
same pageant were advanced two hills or mountains of convenient
height.</p>

<p>The one of them, being on the north side of the same
pageant, was made cragged, barren, and stony; in the which
was erected one tree, artificially made, all withered and
dead, with branches accordingly. And under the same
tree, at the foot thereof, sat one, in homely and rude
apparel, crookedly, and in mourning manner, having over
his head in a table, written in Latin and English, his name,
which was</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt"><i>RUINOSA RESPUBLICA</i></em>,</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">A DECAYED COMMON WEAL.</em>
</p>

<p>And upon the same withered tree, were fixed certain tables
wherein were written proper Sentences, expressing the causes
of the Decay of the Common weal.</p>

<p>The other hill, on the south side, was made fair, fresh,
green, and beautiful; the ground thereof full of flowers and
beauty. And on the same was erected also one tree, very
fresh and fair; under which, stood upright one fresh personage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
well apparelled and appointed; whose name also was written,
both in English and in Latin, which was</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt"><i>RESPUBLICA BENE INSTITUTA</i></em>,</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">A FLOURISHING COMMON WEAL.</em>
</p>

<p>And upon the same tree also, were fixed certain tables containing
Sentences, which expressed the causes of a Flourishing
Common weal.</p>

<p>In the middle, between the said hills, was made artificially,
one hollow place or cave, with door and lock
enclosed; out of which, a little before the Queen's Highness's
coming thither, issued one personage, whose name was
<span class="smcap">Time</span> (apparelled as an old man, with a scythe in his hands,
having wings artificially made), leading a personage, of less
stature than himself, which was finely and well apparelled,
all clad in white silk; and directly over her head was set
her name and title, in Latin and English, <span class="smcap">Temporis Filia,</span>
<span class="smcap">The Daughter of Time</span>.</p>

<p>Which two, so appointed, went forward, towards the south
side of the pageant.</p>

<p>And on her breast was written her proper name, <span class="smcap">Veritas,</span>
<span class="smcap">Truth</span>; who held a book in her hand, upon the which was
written, <i>Verbum Veritatis, The Word of Truth</i>.</p>

<p>And out of the south side of the pageant, was cast a
standing for a child, which should interpret the same pageant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against whom, when the Queen's Majesty came, he spake
unto Her Grace these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>When the child had thus ended his speech, he reached
his book towards the Queen's Majesty; which, a little before,
<span class="smcap">Truth</span> had let down unto him from the hill: which by Sir
<span class="smcap">John Parrat</span> was received, and delivered unto the Queen.</p>

<p>But she, as soon as she had received the book, kissed it;
and with both her hands held up the same, and so laid
it upon her breast; with great thanks to the City therefore.
And so went forward toward Paul's Churchyard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The former matter, which was rehearsed unto the Queen's
Majesty, was written in two tables, on either side the
pageant, eight verses: and in the midst, these in Latin.</p>

Grace to come out of the House of Unity; the second, that
she is placed in the Seat of Government, stayed with virtues
to the suppression of vice; and therefore in the third, the
Eight Blessings of Almighty GOD might well be applied
unto her: so this fourth now, is to put Her Grace in remembrance
of the state of the Common Weal, which <span class="smcap">Time</span>, with
<span class="smcap">Truth</span> his daughter, doth reveal: which <span class="smcap">Truth</span> also, Her
Grace hath received; and therefore cannot but be merciful
and careful for the good government thereof.</p>

appointed by the Schoolmaster thereof, pronounced a certain
Oration in Latin, and certain Verses: which also were there
written, as follows.</p>

<p>Which the Queen's Majesty most attentively hearkened
unto. And when the child had pronounced, he did kiss the
Oration, which he had there fair written on paper, and delivered
it unto the Queen's Majesty, which most gently received the
same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And when the Queen's Majesty had heard all that was
there offered to be spoken; then Her Grace marched toward
Ludgate: where she was received with a noise of instruments;
the forefront of the Gate being finely trimmed against
Her Majesty's coming.</p>

<p>From thence, by the way, as she went down toward Fleet
Bridge, one about Her Grace, noted the City's charge, that
"there was no cost spared."</p>

<p>Her Grace answered, that "She did well consider the same,
and that it should be remembered!" An honourable answer,
worthy a noble Prince: which may comfort all her subjects,
considering there can be no point of gentleness or obedient
love shewed towards Her Grace; which she doth not most
tenderly accept, and graciously weigh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this manner, the people on either side rejoicing, Her
Grace went forward towards the Conduit in Fleet Street,
where was the fifth and last pageant, erected in the form
following.</p>

<p>From the Conduit, which was beautified with painting, unto
the north side of the street, was erected a Stage embattled
with four towers, and in the same, a square plat rising with
degrees.</p>

<p>Upon the uppermost degree was placed a Chair or royal
Seat; and behind the same Seat, in curious artificial manner,
was erected a tree of reasonable height, and so far advanced
above the seat as it did well and seemly shadow the same,
without endamaging the sight of any part of the pageant.
And the same tree was beautified with leaves as green as Art
could devise, being of a convenient greatness and containing
thereupon the fruit of the date tree; and on the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
same tree, in a table was set the name thereof, which was,
<i>A Palm Tree</i>.</p>

<p>And in the aforesaid Seat or Chair was a seemly and meet
personage, richly apparelled in Parliament robes, with a
sceptre in her hand, as a Queen; crowned with an open crown:
whose name and title were in a table fixed over her head in
this sort, <i><span class="smcap">Deborah</span>, The Judge and Restorer of Israel</i>. Judic. 4.</p>

<p>And the other degrees, on either side, were furnished with
six personages; two representing the Nobility, two the Clergy,
and two the Commonalty. And before these personages, was
written in a table,</p>

<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">DEBORAH, WITH HER ESTATES,
CONSULTING FOR THE GOOD
GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL.</em>
</p>

<p>At the feet of these, and the lowest part of the pageant,
was ordained a convenient room for a child to open the
meaning of the pageant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Queen's Majesty drew near unto this pageant;
and perceived, as in the others, the child ready to speak:
Her Grace required silence, and commanded her chariot to be
removed nigher that she might plainly hear the child speak;
which said, as hereafter followeth:</p>

in Latin also.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The void places of the pageant were filled with pretty
Sentences concerning the same matter.</p>

<p>The ground of this last pageant was, that forasmuch as
the next pageant before, had set before Her Grace's eyes the
Flourishing and Desolate States of a Common Weal; she
might by this, be put in remembrance to consult for the worthy
Government of her people; considering GOD, ofttimes, sent
women nobly to rule among men, as <span class="smcap">Deborah</span> which governed
Israel in peace, the space of forty years; and that it behoveth
both men and women so ruling, to use advice of good counsel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Queen's Majesty had passed this pageant; she
marched towards Temple Bar.</p>

<p>But at St. Dunstan's, where the children of the Hospital
[<i>i.e., Christ's Hospital, now known as the Blue Coat School, see</i>
<i>p. <a href="#Page_246">246</a></i>], were appointed to stand with their Governors; Her
Grace perceiving a child offered to make an oration unto her,
stayed her chariot; and did cast up her eyes to heaven, as who
should say, "I here see this merciful work towards the poor;
whom I must, in the midst of my royalty, needs remember."
And so, turned her face towards the child, which, in Latin,
pronounced an Oration to this effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That after the Queen's Highness had passed through
the City; and had seen so sumptuous, rich, and noble
spectacles of the citizens, which declared their most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
hearty receiving and most joyous welcoming of Her
Grace into the same: this one Spectacle yet rested and
remained; which was the everlasting Spectacle of
Mercy unto the poor members of Almighty GOD, furthered
by that famous and most noble Prince, King
<span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>, Her Grace's Father; erected by the City
of London; and advanced by the most godly, virtuous,
and gracious Prince, King <span class="smcap">Edward VI.</span>, Her Grace's dear
and loving brother. Doubting nothing of the mercy of
the Queen's most gracious clemency: by the which they
may not only be relieved and helped, but also stayed
and defended; and therefore incessantly, they would
pray and cry unto Almighty GOD for the long life and
reign of Her Highness, with most prosperous victory
against her enemies.</p></div>

<p>The child, after he had ended his Oration, kissed the paper
wherein the same was written, and reached it to the Queen's
Majesty; who received it graciously both with words and
countenance, declaring her gracious mind towards their relief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From thence, Her Grace came to Temple Bar, which was
dressed finely, with the two images of <span class="smcap">Gotmagot</span> the Albion,
and <span class="smcap">Corineus</span> the Briton; two giants big in stature, furnished
accordingly: which held in their hands, even above the gate,
a table, wherein was written, in Latin verses, the effect of all
the pageants which the City before had erected. Which
Verses are these:</p>

<p>On the south side [<i>i.e., of Fleet Street, at Temple Bar</i>] was
appointed by the City, a noise of singing children; and one child
richly attired as a Poet, which gave the Queen's Majesty
her Farewell, in the name of the whole City, by these words.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As at thine Entrance first, O Prince of high renown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast presented with Tongues and Hearts for thy fair;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As by His grace puissant, so in His truth constant!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell! O worthy Queen! and as our hope is sure,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So trust we that thou wilt our sovereign Queen endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loving Lady stand, from henceforth, evermore!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While these words were in saying, and certain wishes
therein repeated for the maintenance of Truth, and rooting
out of Error; she, now and then, held up her hands to heaven-ward,
and willed the people to say "Amen!"</p>

<p>When the child had ended, she said, "Be ye well assured,
I will stand your good Queen!"</p>

<p>At which saying, Her Grace departed forth, through Temple
Bar towards Westminster, with no less shooting [<i>i.e., firing</i>
<i>of guns</i>] and crying of the people, than, when she entered the
City, with a great noise of ordnance which the Tower shot off,
at Her Grace's entrance first into Tower Street.</p>

<p>Thus the Queen's Highness passed through the City! which,
without any foreign person, of itself, beautified itself; and received
Her Grace at all places, as hath been before mentioned,
with most tender obedience and love, due to so gracious a
Queen, and sovereign Lady.</p>

<p>And Her Grace likewise, of her side, in all Her Grace's
Passage, shewed herself generally an Image of a worthy Lady
and Governor; but privately these especial points were noted
in Her Grace, as signs of a most Prince-like courage, whereby
her loving subjects may ground a sure hope for the rest of
her gracious doings hereafter.</p>

<h3><i>Certain Notes of the Queen's Majesty's</i>
<i>great mercy, clemency, and wisdom</i>
<i>used in this Passage.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/245a.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">About</span> the nether end of Cornhill, toward Cheap,
one of the Knights about Her Grace, had espied
an ancient Citizen which wept, and turned his
head back. And therewith said this Gentleman,
"Yonder is an Alderman," for so he termed him,
"which weepeth, and turneth his face backward! How may it
be interpreted that he doth so? For sorrow! or for gladness?"</p>

<p>The Queen's Majesty heard him; and said, "I warrant
you, it is for gladness!" A gracious interpretation of a noble
courage, which would turn the doubtful to the best. And
yet it was well known, that (as Her Grace did confirm the
same) the party's cheer was moved, for very pure gladness
for the sight of Her Majesty's person; at the beholding
whereof, he took such comfort, that with tears he expressed
the same.</p>

<p>In Cheapside, Her Grace smiled; and being thereof demanded
the cause, answered, "For that she had heard one
say, <i>Remember old King <span class="smcap">Henry VIII</span>!</i>" A natural child!
which at the very remembrance of her father's name took so
great a joy; that all men may well think that as she rejoiced
at his name whom this Realm doth hold of so worthy memory,
so, in her doings, she will resemble the same.</p>

<p>When the City's charge without partiality, and only the
City, was mentioned unto Her Grace; she said, "It should
not be forgotten!" Which saying might move all natural
Englishmen heartily to shew due obedience and entireness to
their so good a Queen, which will, in no point, forget any
parcel of duty lovingly shewed unto her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer which Her Grace made unto Master Recorder
of London, as the hearers know it to be true and with melting
hearts heard the same, so may the reader thereof conceive
what kind of stomach and courage pronounced the same.</p>

<p>What more famous thing do we read in ancient histories
of old time, than that mighty Princes have gently received
presents offered them by base and low personages. If that
be to be wondered at, as it is passingly! let me see any writer
that in any one Prince's life is able to recount so many precedents
of this virtue, as Her Grace shewed in that one
Passage through the City. How many nosegays did Her
Grace receive at poor women's hands? How ofttimes stayed
she her chariot, when she saw any simple body offer to speak
to Her Grace? A branch of rosemary given to Her Grace,
with a supplication, by a poor woman, about Fleet Bridge,
was seen in her chariot till Her Grace came to Westminster;
notwithstanding the marvellous wondering of such as knew
the presenter, and noted the Queen's most gracious receiving
and keeping the same.</p>

<p>What hope the poor and needy may look for, at Her
Grace's hand; she, as in all her journey continually, so in her
hearkening to the poor children of Christ's Hospital, with
eyes cast up unto heaven, did fully declare; as that neither
the wealthier estate could stand without consideration had to
the poverty, neither the poverty be duly considered unless
they were remembered, as commanded to us by GOD's own
mouth.</p>

<p>As at her first Entrance, she, as it were, declared herself
prepared to pass through a City that most entirely loved her;
so she, at her last Departing, as it were, bound herself by
promise to continue good Lady and Governor unto that City,
which, by outward declaration, did open their love to their so
loving and noble Prince, in such wise as she herself wondered
thereat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But because Princes be set in their Seat by GOD's appointment,
and therefore they must first and chiefly render the
glory of Him from whom their glory issueth; it is to be
noted in Her Grace, that, forasmuch as GOD hath so
wonderfully placed her in the Seat of Government over this
realm; she in all doings, doth shew herself most mindful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
His goodness and mercy shewed unto her. And amongst all
other, two principal signs thereof were noted in this Passage.</p>

<p>First, in the Tower: where Her Grace, before she entered
her chariot, lifted up her eyes to heaven, and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O LORD! Almighty and everlasting GOD! I give Thee
most hearty thanks, that as Thou hast been so merciful
unto me, as to spare me to behold this joyful day! And I
acknowledge that Thou hast dealt as wonderfully and
mercifully with me, as Thou didst with thy true and
faithful servant <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, the prophet; whom thou deliveredst
out of the den, from the cruelty of the greedy
and raging lions: even so, was I overwhelmed, and only
by Thee! delivered. To Thee! therefore, only, be thanks,
honour, and praise for ever! Amen.</p></div>

<p>The second was, the receiving of the <i>Bible</i>, at the Little
Conduit, in Cheap. For when Her Grace had learned that
the <i>Bible</i> in English, should there be offered; she thanked
the City therefore, promised the reading thereof most diligently,
and incontinent commanded that it should be brought. At
the receipt whereof, how reverently, she did, with both her
hands, take it! kiss it! and lay it on her breast! to the great
comfort of the lookers on!</p>

<p>GOD will undoubtedly preserve so worthy a Prince; which,
at His honour, so reverently taketh her beginning. For this
saying is true, and written in the Book of Truth: "He that
first seeketh the Kingdom of GOD, shall have all other things
cast unto him."</p>

<p>Now, therefore, all English hearts, and her natural people
must needs praise GOD's mercy, which hath sent them so
worthy a Prince; and pray for Her Grace's long continuance
amongst us.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">How</span> well, and how strongly our country hath been
furnished, in times past, with armour and artillery,
it lieth not in me, as of myself to make
rehearsal.</p>

<p>Yet that it lacked both, in the late time of
Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>; not only the experience of mine elders, but
also the talk of certain Spaniards, not yet forgotten, did
leave some manifest notice.</p>

<p>Upon the first, I need not stand: for few will deny it.</p>

<p>For the second, I have heard that when one of the greatest
Peers of Spain [<i>evidently in Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>'s reign</i>] espied our
nakedness in this behalf, and did solemnly utter in no
obscure place, that "It should be an easy matter, in short
time, to conquer England; because it wanted armour!" his
words were then not so rashly uttered, as they were politicly
noted.</p>

<p>For, albeit, that, for the present time, their efficacy was
dissembled; and semblance made as though he spake but
merrily: yet at the very Entrance of this our gracious Queen
unto the possession of the Crown, they were so providently
called to remembrance, and such speedy reformation sought,
of all hands, for the redress of this inconveniency, that our
country was sooner furnished with armour and munition
from divers parts of the main [<i>the Continent</i>], besides great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
plenty that was forged here at home, than our enemies could
get understanding of any such provision to be made.</p>

<p>By this policy also, was the no small hope conceived by
Spaniards utterly cut off; who (of open friends, being now
become our secret enemies; and thereto watching a time
wherein to achieve some heavy exploit against us and our
country) did thereupon change their purposes: whereby
England obtained rest; that otherwise might have been
sure of sharp and cruel wars.</p>

<p>Thus a Spanish word uttered by one man at one time,
overthrew, or, at the least, hindered sundry privy practices
of many at another time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In times past, the chief force of England consisted in their
long bows. But now we have in manner generally given over
that kind of artillery, and for long bows indeed, do practice
to shoot compass for our pastime; which kind of shooting
can never yield any smart stroke, nor beat down our enemies,
as our countrymen were wont to do, at every time of need.
Certes, the Frenchmen and Reitters [<i>i.e., Reiters, the German</i>
<i>or Swiss Lance-knights</i>] deriding our new archery, in respect
of their corslets, will not let, in open skirmish, if any leisure
serve, to turn up their tails, and cry, "Shoot, English!"
and all because our strong shooting is decayed, and laid in
bed.</p>

<p>But if some of our Englishmen now lived, that served
King <span class="smcap">Edward III.</span> in his wars with France: the breech of
such a varlet had been nailed to his back with one arrow;
and another feathered in his bowels, before he should have
turned about to see who shot the first.</p>

<p>But as our shooting is thus, in manner, utterly decayed
among us one way: so our countrymen wax skilful in sundry
other points; as in shooting in small pieces, the caliver,
and handling of the pike; in the several uses whereof, they
are become very expert.</p>

<p>Our armour differeth not from that of other nations; and
therefore consisteth of corslets, almain rivets, shirts of
mail, jacks quilted and covered with leather, fustian, or
canvas over thick plates of iron that are sewed in the same.
Of which, there is no town or village that hath not her
convenient furniture. The said armour and munition like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>wise
is kept in one several place of every town, appointed
by the consent of the whole parish; where it is always
ready to be had and worn within an hour's warning.</p>

<p>Sometimes also it is occupied [<i>used</i>], when it pleaseth the
magistrate, either to view the able men and take note of the
well keeping of the same; or finally to see those that are enrolled,
to exercise each one his several weapon: at the charge
of the townsmen of each parish, according to his appointment.
Certes there is almost no village so poor in England,
be it never so small, that hath not sufficient furniture in
a readiness to set forth three or four soldiers (as, one archer,
one gunner, one pike, and a bill-man), at the least. No,
there is not so much wanting as their very liveries [<i>uniforms</i>]
and caps; which are least to be accounted of, if any haste
required. So that if this good order continue, it shall be
impossible for the sudden enemy to find us unprovided.</p>

<p>As for able men for service, thanked be GOD! we are
not without good store. For by the Musters taken in 1574
and 1575, our number amounted to 1,172,674; and yet they
were not so narrowly taken, but that a third part of this
like multitude was left unbilled and uncalled.</p>

<p>What store of munition and armour, the Queen's Majesty
hath in her storehouses, it lieth not in me to yield account;
sith I suppose the same to be infinite. And whereas it was
commonly said, after the loss of Calais, that England would
never recover the store of ordnance there left and lost; the
same is proved false: since some of the same persons do
now confess that this land was never better furnished with
these things in any King's days, since the Conquest.</p>

<p>The names of our greatest ordnance are commonly
these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Robinet</i>, whose weight is 200 lbs.; and it hath 1&frac14;
inches within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Falconet</i>, weighing 500 lbs., and his wideness is 2 inches
within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Falcon</i> hath 800 lbs., and 2&frac12; inches within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Minion</i> poiseth [<i>weigheth</i>] 1,100 lbs., and hath 3&frac14; inches
within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Sacre</i> hath 1,500 lbs., and is 3&frac12; inches wide in the
mouth.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Demi-Culverin</i> weigheth 3,000 lbs., and hath 4&frac12; inches
within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Culverin</i> hath 4,000 lbs., and 5&frac12; inches within the
mouth.</p>

<p><i>Demi-Cannon</i>, 6,000 lbs., and 6&frac12; inches within the
mouth.</p>

<p><i>Cannon</i>, 7,000 lbs., and 8 inches within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>E. Cannon</i>, 8,000 lbs., and 7 inches within the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Basilisk</i>, 9,000 lbs., and 8&frac34; inches within the mouth.</p></div>

<p>By which proportions, also, it is easy to come by the
weight of every shot, how many scores [<i>i.e., of yards</i>] it doth
fly at point blank, how much powder is to be had to the
same, and finally how many inches in height, each bullet
ought to carry.</p>

<p>As for the Armouries of some of the Nobility (whereof I
also have seen a part), they are so well furnished, that within
some one Baron's custody, I have seen three score or a

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> perusing your Loving Folly, and your Declining
from it; I do behold Reason conquering Passion.
The infirmity of loving argueth you are a man;
the firmness thereof, discovereth a good wit and
the best nature: and the falling from it, true virtue. Beauty
was always of force to mislead the wisest; and men of
greatest perfection have had no power to resist Love. The
best are accompanied with vices, to exercise their virtues;
whose glory shineth brightest in resisting motives of pleasure,
and in subduing affections. And though I cannot altogether
excuse your Loving Folly; yet I do the less blame you, in
that you loved such a one as was more to be commended for
her virtue, than beauty: albeit even for that too, she was so
well accomplished with the gifts of Nature as in mine conceit
(which, for good cause, I must submit as inferior to yours)
there was nothing wanting, either in the one or the other,
that might add more to her worth, except it were a more
due and better regard of your love; which she requited not
according to your deserts, nor answerable to herself in her
other parts of perfection. Yet herein it appeareth you have
made good use of Reason; that being heretofore lost in
youthful vanity, have now, by timely discretion, found yourself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me entreat you to suffer these your Passionate Sonnets
to be published! which may, peradventure, make others,
possessed with the like Humour of Loving, to follow your
example, in leaving; and move other <span class="smcap">Alcilias</span> (if there be
any) to embrace deserving love, while they may!</p>

<p>Hereby, also, she shall know, and, it may be, inwardly
repent the loss of your love, and see how much her perfections
are blemished by ingratitude; which will make your
happiness greater by adding to your reputation, than your
contentment could have been in enjoying her love. At the
least wise, the wiser sort, however in censuring them, they
may dislike of your errors; yet they cannot but commend
and allow of your reformation: and all others that shall with
indifferency read them, may reap thereby some benefit, or
contentment.</p>

<p>Thus much I have written as a testimony of the good will
I bear you! with whom I do suffer or rejoice according to
the quality of your misfortune or good hap. And so I take

<span class="i0">Who, were his passage stopped by sword and fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would make way through, to compass his Desire.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">These be the things wherein I glory most,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For when as he, <span class="smcap">Alcilia</span> first affected,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Like one in show, that love little respected)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He masqued, disguised, and entertained his thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hope of that, which he in secret sought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still forbare to utter his desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his delay receive her worthy hire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well we know, what maids themselves would have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men must sue for, and by petition crave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he regarding more his Wealth, than Will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath little care his Fancy to fulfil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when he saw <span class="smcap">Alcilia</span> loved another;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret fire, which in his breast did smother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to smoke, and soon had proved a flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Temperance had not allayed the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, afterward, so quenched he did not find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that some sparks remain&egrave;d still behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, when time served, he did refuse to crave it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet envied another man should have it!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As though, fair maids should wait, at young men's pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst they, 'twixt sport and earnest, love at leisure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, at the first! when it is kindly proffered!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet may they lose the better of their fortune.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, as this Fondling coldly went about it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in the end, he clearly went without it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For while he, doubtful, seemed to make a stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Mongrel stole the maiden's heart away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which, though he lamented much in shew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet was he, inward, glad it fell out so.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, <span class="smcap">Reason</span>! you may plainly judge by this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not I, but he, the false dissembler is:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, while fond hope his lukewarm love did feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sign of more than he sustained indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled his rhymes with fables and with lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, without Passion, he did oft devise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to delude the ignorance of such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pitied him, thinking he loved too much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with conceit, rather to shew his Wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than manifest his faithful Love by it.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much more than this, could I lay to his charge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But time would fail to open all at large.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let this suffice to prove his bad intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prove that <span class="smcap">Love</span> is clear and innocent."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus, at the length, though late, he made an end,<br /></span>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/299a.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">All</span> things concurred for the rising and
maintenance of this State: the disposition
of the people, being as mutinous as
industrious and frugal; the nature of the
country, everywhere fortifiable with water;
the situation of it, having behind them the
Baltic sea, which yields them all materials
for ships, and many other commodities;
and for men, hard before them France and England, both
fearing the Spanish greatness, and therefore both concurring
for their aid; the remoteness of their Master from them; the
change of religion, falling out about the time of their Revolt;
and now the Marquis of <span class="smcap">Brandenburgh</span>, a Protestant, like[ly]
to become [the] Duke of <span class="smcap">Cleve</span>.</p>

<p>The discontentments of the Low Countries did first appear
soon after the going away of the Kings of Spain, while the
Duchess of <span class="smcap">Parma</span> governed. To suppress which beginnings,
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Alva</span> being sent, inflamed them more upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
attempting to bring in the Inquisition, and Spanish decimation;
upon the beheading of Count <span class="smcap">Horn</span> and Count
<span class="smcap">Egmont</span>, persecuting those of the Religion: and undertaking
to build citadels upon all their towns; which he effected at
Antwerp, but enterprising the like at Flushing, that town
revolted first, and under it began the war.</p>

<p>But the more general Revolt of the Provinces happened
after the death of Don <span class="smcap">Louis de Requiescens</span>, and upon
the coming down of Don <span class="smcap">John</span> of Austria: when all the
Provinces, excepting Luxemburg (upon the sack of Antwerp
and other insolences), proclaimed the Spaniards "rebels, and
enemies to the King." Yet the abjuring of their obedience
from the Crown of Spain, was not in a year or two after.</p>

<p>Holland and Zealand (upon their first standing out) offered
the Sovereignty of themselves to the Queen, then the Protection,
both which she neglected; and that, while the French
sent greater aid, and more men of quality than we: but after
the Civil War began in France, that kept them busy at home;
and then the Queen, seeing the necessity of their being
supported, upon the pawning of Brill and Flushing, sent
money and men. And since that, most part of the great
exploits there, have been done by the English, who were
commonly the third part of their army; being four regiments,
besides 1,100 in Flushing and the Ramekins, and 500 in the
Brill. But, of late, the King of France appearing more for
them than ours, and paying himself the French [soldiers]
that are there; they give equal, if not more countenance to
that nation. But upon these two Kings, they make their
whole dependency: and though with more respect to him that
is stronger for the time; yet so, as it may give no distaste
unto the other.</p>

<p>For the manner of their Government. They have, upon
occasion, an Assembly of the General States, like our
Parliament; being composed of those which are sent from
every Province upon summons; and what these Enact, stands
for Law. Then is there besides, a Council of State, residing,
for the most part, at the Hague: which attends [to] daily
occasions; being rather employed upon Affairs of State than
particular [<i>individual</i>] justice. The most potent in this
Council was <span class="smcap">Barneveld</span>, by reason of his Advocates of
Holland. And besides both these, every Province and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Town have particular Councils of their own. To all which
Assemblies, as well of the General States as the rest, the
gentry is called for order sake, but the State indeed is
democratical: the merchant and the tradesman being predominant,
the gentry, now, but few and poor; and, even at
the beginning, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> saw it safer to rely
upon the towns than [upon] them. Neither are the gentry
so much engaged in the Cause: the people having more
advantages in a Free State; they, in a Monarchy.</p>

<p>Their care in Government is very exact and particular, by
reason that every one hath an immediate interest in the State.
Such is the equality of justice, that it renders every man satisfied;
such is the public regularity, as a man may see [that]
their laws were made to guide, and not to entrap; such their
exactness in casting the expense of an army, as that it shall
be equally far from superfluity and want; and as much order
and certainty in their acts of war, as in ours of peace;
teaching it to be both civil and rich. And they still retain
that sign of a Commonwealth yet uncorrupted, "Private
poverty, and public weal!" for no one private man there is
exceeding rich, and few very poor; and no State more
sumptuous in all public things. But the question is, whether
this, being a free State, will, as well subsist in peace, as it hath
hitherto done in war. Peace leaving every one to attend [to]
his particular wealth: when fear, while the war lasts, makes
them concur for their common safety. And Zealand, upon
the least security, hath ever been envious at the predominancy
of Holland and Utrecht; ready to mutiny for religion: and
besides, it is a doubt, whether the same care and sincerity
would continue if they were at their Consistence, as appears
yet, while they are but in Rising.</p>

<p>The Revenue of this State ariseth chiefly from the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Holland</span>'s domains; and confiscated church livings; the
rising and falling of money, which they use with much
advantage; their fishing upon our coasts, and those of
Norway; contributions out of the enemy's country, taxes
upon all things at home, and impositions [<i>import duties</i>] upon
all merchandise from abroad.</p>

<p>Their Expenses upon their Ambassadors, their shipping,
their ditches, their rampiers [<i>dykes</i>] and munition; and
commonly they have in pay, by sea and land, 60,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>For the strength. The nature of the country makes them
able to defend themselves long by land. Neither could
anything have endangered them so much as the last great
frost [<i>of 1608, see Vol. I. p. 77</i>], had not the Treaty been then
on foot: because the enemy, being then master of the field;
that rendered their ditches, marshes, and rivers as firm ground.</p>

<p>There belongs to that State, 20,000 vessels of all sorts. So
that if the Spaniard were entirely beaten out of those parts;
the Kings of France and England would take as much pains
to suppress, as ever they did to raise them. For being our
enemies, they are [<i>would be</i>] able to give us the law at sea;
and eat us out of all trade, much more the French: having
at this time three ships for our one, though none so good as
our best.</p>

<p>Now that whereupon the most part of their Revenue
depends is their traffic, in which mystery of State they are, at
this day, the wisest. For all the commodities that this part
of the world wants, and the Indies have (as spice, silk, jewels,
gold), they are become the conveyers of them for the rest of
Christendom, excepting us: as the Venetians were of old.
And all those commodities that those Northern countries
abound with, and these Southern countries stand in need of:
they likewise convey thither; which was the ancient trade of
the Easterlings [<i>Baltic cities</i>]. And this they do, having little
to export of their own, by buying of their neighbour-countries
the former; and selling them again what they bring back, at
their own prices: and so consequently, live upon the idleness
of others. And to this purpose, their situation serves fitly.
For the rivers of the Rhine, the Maas, and [the] Scheldt
all end in their dominions; and the Baltic sea lies not far
from them: all which afford them whatever the great continent
of Germany, Russia, and Poland yields.</p>

<p>Then they, again, lying between Germany and the sea, do
furnish it back, with all commodities foreign.</p>

<p>To remember some pieces of their discipline, as patterns
of the rest. The Watches at night are never all of one
nation [<i>race</i>], so that they can hardly concur to give up any
one town. The Commissaries are nowhere so strict upon
Musters, and where he finds a company thither, he reduceth
them: so that, when an army marcheth, the List and the Poll
are never far disagreeing. The army is ever well clothed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
well armed; and had never yet occasion to mutiny for
pay or victuals. The soldiers commit nowhere fewer insolences
upon the burghers, few robberies upon the country;
nor the Officers fewer deceits upon the soldiers. And lastly,
they provide well that their General shall have small means
to invade their liberties. For first, their Army is composed of
many nations, which have their several Commanders; and the
commands are disposed by the States themselves, not by the
General. And secondly, he hath never an implicit commission
left to discretion: but, by reason their country hath no great
bounds, receives daily commands what to do.</p>

<p>Their territory contains six entire Provinces; Holland,
Zealand, Utrecht, Groningen, Overyssel, and Friesland,
besides three parts of Guelderland, and certain towns in
Brabant and Flanders: the ground of which is, for the most
part, fruitful; the towns nowhere are so <i>equally</i> beautiful,
strong, and rich: which equality grows by reason that they
appropriate some one staple commodity to every town of
note; only Amsterdam not only passeth them all, but even
Seville, Lisbon, or any other Mart Town in Christendom. And
to it, is appropriated the trade of the East Indies, where they
maintain commonly forty ships; besides which, there go, twice
a year, from it and the adjoining towns, a great fleet to the
Baltic sea. Upon the fall of Antwerp, that [town of Amsterdam]
rose, rather than Middleburgh; though it [<i>that</i>] stands at the
same river's mouth, and is the second Mart Town; to which
is appropriated our English cloth.</p>

<p>Concerning the people. They are neither much devout, nor
much wicked; given all to drink, and, eminently, to no other
vice; hard in bargaining, but just; surly, and respectless, as in
all democracies; thirsty [?<i>thrifty</i>], industrious, and cleanly; disheartened
upon the least ill-success, and insolent upon good;
inventive in manufactures; cunning in traffic. And generally,
for matter of action, that natural slowness of theirs suits
better (by reason of the advisedness and perseverance it
brings with it) than the rashness and changeableness of the
French and Florentine wits. And the equality of spirits
which is among them and the Swiss, renders them so fit for a
Democracy; which kind of Government, nations, of more unstable
wits, being once come to a Consistent Greatness, have
seldom long endured.</p>

<h3><i>Observations upon the State of the</i><br />

<i>Archduke's Country, 1609.</i><br />

By Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Overbury</span>.
</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/304a.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as I entered into the Archduke's
country, which begins after Lillow;
presently, I beheld [the] works of a Province,
and those of a Province distressed
with war. The people heartless; and
rather repining against their Governors
than revengeful against their enemies.
The bravery of that gentry which was
left, and the industry of the merchant, quite decayed. The
husbandman labouring only to live, without desire to be
rich to another's use. The towns (whatsoever concerned
not the strength of them) ruinous. And, to conclude, the
people here growing poor with less taxes, than they flourish
with on the States' side.</p>

<p>This war hath kept the King of Spain busy ever since it
began, which [is] some thirty-eight years ago: and, spending
all the money that the Indies, and all the men that Spain and
Italy could afford, hath withdrawn him from persevering in
any other enterprise. Neither could he give over this,
without foregoing the means to undertake anything hereafter
upon France or England; and, consequently, the Hope of the
Western Monarchy. For without that handle [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>that hope</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the mines of Peru had done little hurt in these parts, in comparison
of what they have. The cause of the expensefulness
of it, is the remoteness of those Provinces from Spain; by
reason of which every soldier of Spain or Italy, before he can
arrive there, costs the King a 100 crowns [= <i>&pound;30 then</i> = <i>&pound;135</i>
<i>now</i>], and not above one in ten that arrive, proves good.
Besides, by reason of the distance, a great part of the money
is drunk up betwixt the Officers that convey it, and pay it.</p>

<p>The cause of the continuance of it, is not only the strength
of the enemy; but partly, by reason that the Commanders
themselves are content [that] the war should last, so to maintain
and render themselves necessary; and partly, because
the people of those Countries are not so eager to have the other
reduced, as willing to be in the like state themselves.</p>

<p>The usual revenue of those Provinces which the Archduke
hath, amounts to 1,200,000 crowns [= <i>at 6s. the Crown,</i>
<i>&pound;360,000 then</i> = <i>about &pound;1,600,000 now</i>] a year. Besides which,
there come from Spain every month, to maintain the war,
150,000 crowns [= <i>&pound;45,000 a month, or &pound;540,000 a year, then</i>;
= <i>&pound;2,430,000 annually now</i>]. It was, at the first, 300,000
crowns a month [<i>or, in present annual value, about &pound;5,000,000</i>];
but it fell by fifties [<i>i.e., 50,000</i>] to this, at the time when the
Treaty began. Flanders pays more towards the war, than
all the rest; as Holland doth, with the States. There is no
Spaniard of [<i>belonging to</i>] the Council of State, nor Governor
of any Province: but of the Council of War, which is only
active; there [<i>in which</i>] they only are, and have in their hands
all the strong towns and castles of those Provinces, of which
the Governors have but only the title.</p>

<p>The nations of which their army consists are chiefly
Spaniards and Italians, emulous one of another there; as on
the other side, [are] the French and English: and of the
country, chiefly Burgundians and Walloons. The Pope's
Letters, and <span class="smcap">Spinola</span>'s inclination keep the Italians there;
almost in equality of command with the Spaniard himself.</p>

<p>The Governors for the King of Spain there, successively,
have been the Duke of <span class="smcap">Alva</span>, Don <span class="smcap">Louis de Requiescens</span>,
Don <span class="smcap">John</span> of Austria, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Parma</span>, the Archduke
<span class="smcap">Earnest</span>, the Cardinal <span class="smcap">Andrew</span> of Austria, and the Cardinal
<span class="smcap">Albert</span> till he married the Infanta.</p>

<p>Where the dominion of the Archduke and the States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
part, there also changeth the nature of the country; that is,
about Antwerp. For all below, being flat, and betwixt meadow
and marsh; thence, it begins to rise and become champion
[<i>open country</i>]: and consequently, the people are more quick
and spiritful, as the Brabanter, Fleming, and Walloon.</p>

<p>The most remarkable place on that side is Antwerp, which
rose upon the fall of Bruges; equally strong and beautiful;
remaining yet so upon the strength of its former greatness:
twice spoiled by the Spaniards, and the like attempted by the
French. The Citadel was built there by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Alva</span>,
but renewed by the Prince of <span class="smcap">Parma</span>, after his eighteen
months' besieging it; the town accepting a castle, rather than
a garrison to mingle among them. There are yet in the
town, of citizens 30,000 fighting men, 600 of which keep
watch nightly; but they [are] allowed neither cannon upon
the rampier [<i>ramparts</i>], nor magazines of powder. In the
Castle are 200 pieces of ordnance, and commonly 700 or 800
soldiers.</p>

<h3><i>Observations on the State of France, 1609,</i>
<i>under <span class="smcap">Henry IV</span>.</i><br />

By Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Overbury</span>.
</h3>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Having</span> seen the form of a Commonwealth,
and a Province, with the different effects
of wars in them; I entered France,
flourishing with peace; and of Monarchies,
the most absolute. Because the King there,
not only makes peace and war, calls
and dissolves Parliaments, pardoneth,
naturaliseth, ennobleth, names the value
of money, [im]presseth to the war; but even makes laws, and
imposes taxes at his pleasure. And all this he doth alone.
For, as for that form that his Edicts must be authorised by
the next Court of Parliament, that is, the next Court of
Sovereign Justice: first, the Presidents thereof are to be
chosen by him, and to be put out by him; and secondly,
when they concur not with the King, he passeth anything
without them, as he did the last Edict [? <i>of Nantes</i>] for the
Protestants. And for the Assembly of the Three Estates, it
is grown now almost as extraordinary as a General Council
[of the Church]; with the loss of which, their liberty fell: and
when occasion urgeth, it is possible for the King to procure
that all those that shall be sent thither, shall be his instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>ments.
For the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> effected as much, at the
Assembly of Blois.</p>

<p>The occasion that first procured the King that supremacy,
that his Edicts should be Laws, was the last invasion of the
English. For, at that time, they possessing two parts of
France, the Three Estates could not assemble: whereupon
they did then grant that power unto <span class="smcap">Charles VII.</span> during
the war. And that which made it easy, for <span class="smcap">Louis XI.</span> and
his successors to continue the same, the occasion ceasing;
was that the Clergy and the Gentry did not run the same
fortune with the People there, as in England. For most of
the taxes falling only upon the people; the Clergy and Gentry,
being foreborne [<i>exempt</i>], were easily induced to leave them
to the King's mercy. But the King having got strength upon
[<i>subverted</i>] the peasants, hath been since the bolder to invade
part of both their [<i>the Clergy's and Gentry's</i>] liberties.</p>

<p>For the succession of this monarchy. It hath subsisted,
without intermission, these 1,200 years, under three Races of
Kings. No nation hath, heretofore, done greater things
abroad, in Palestine and Egypt, besides all parts of Europe;
but, for these last four hundred years, they have only made
sallies into Italy, and [have] often suffered at home. Three
hundred years the English afflicted them, making two firm
invasions upon them, and taking their King prisoner: the
second greatness of Christendom (next [to] the Emperor)
being then in competition betwixt us and them. And to
secure themselves against us, rather than the House of Austria,
as it then stood; they chose to marry the heir of Brittany
before that of Burgundy. And for this last hundred years, the
Spaniard undertaking [<i>attacking</i>] them, hath eaten them out
of all but France, and endangered that too!</p>

<p>But for this present, France had never, as France, a more
entire greatness; though it hath often been richer. For since
the war; the King has only [<i>simply</i>] got aforehand, the country
is but yet in recovering; the war having lasted, by spaces,
thirty two years; and so generally, that [as there was] no man
but had an enemy within three miles, so the country became
frontier all over. Now that which hath made them, at this
time, so largely great at home, is their adopting into themselves
the lesser adjoining nations, without destruction or
leaving any mark of strangeness upon them: as the Bretons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Gascons, Proven&ccedil;als, and others which are not French.
Towards which unions, their nature, which is easy and
harborous [<i>receptive</i>] to strangers; hath done more than any
laws could have effected but with long time.</p>

<p>The King, as I said, enjoying what <span class="smcap">Louis XI.</span> did gain, hath
the entire Sovereignty in himself; because he can make the
Parliament do what he pleases, or else do what he pleases
without them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the other Three Estates. The Church is there very
rich, being estimated to enjoy the third part of the revenue
of France, but otherwise is nothing so potent as elsewhere;
partly because the Inquisition is not admitted in France: but
principally because the Pope's ordinary power is much
restrained there, by the liberties which the French Church
claimeth; which liberties do not so much enfranchise the
Church itself, as confer the authority the Pope loseth upon the
King, as Firstfruits and the Disposing of all spiritual preferments.
And by reason of this neutrality of authority, the
church men [<i>clergy</i>] suffer more there, than either in England,
where they wholly depend upon the King; or in Spain
and Italy, where they wholly subsist by the Pope: because
the Pope is not able totally to support them, and the King
takes occasion ever to suppress them, as being not entirely his
subjects; and to him, they pay, yearly, both the tenth of all
their tithe, and of all their temporal land.</p>

<p>The Gentry are the only entire Body, there, which participate
with the prerogatives of the Crown. For from it, they
receive privileges above all other men and a kind of limited
regality upon their tenants; besides [a] real supply to their
estates by governments and pensions, and freedom from tallies
[<i>taxations</i>] upon their own lands, that is, upon their domains
and whatsoever they manure by their servants: but so
much as they let to tenants is, presently, tallieable [<i>taxable</i>]
which causeth [a] proportionate abatement in the rent.
And in recompense of this, they owe to the King the
Ban and the Arri&egrave;re Ban; that is, to serve him and his
Lieutenant, three months within the land, at their own
charges. And as in war, they undergo the greatest part of
the danger, so then is their power most peremptory above the
rest: whereas in the time of peace, the King is ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
support inferior persons against them, and is glad to see
them to waste one another by contention at law for fear they
grow rich; because he forsees that, as the Nobility, only, can
do him service, so they only, misapplied, can do him harm.</p>

<p>The ancient Gentry of France was most of it consumed in
the wars of <span class="smcap">Godfrey de Boulogne</span>, and some in those of
St. <span class="smcap">Louis</span>; because on their setting out they pawned all
their fiefs to the Church, and few of them were after[wards]
redeemed: by reason, whereof the Church possesseth at
this day the third part of the best fiefs in France. And that
Gentry was afterwards made up by advocates, financiers,
and merchants ennobled, which are now reputed ancient; and
are daily eaten out again, and repaired by the same kind of men.</p>

<p>For the people. All those that have any kind of profession
or trade, live well; but for the mere peasants that labour the
ground, they are only sponges to the King, to the Church, and
to the Nobility! having nothing to their own, but to the use of
them: and are scarce allowed, as beasts, enough to keep
them able to do service; for besides their rent, they pay
usually two-thirds to the King.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The manner of Government in France is mixt between
Peace and War; being composed as well of military discipline
as [of] civil justice: because having open frontiers and
strong neighbours, and therefore obnoxious [<i>liable</i>] to sudden
invasions; they cannot, as in England, join ever peace and
security together.</p>

<p>For the Military Part, there is ever a Constable and a
Marshal in being, troops of horse and regiments of foot in
pay, and in all Provinces and places of strength, Governors
and garrisons distributed: all which are means for the
preferment of the Gentry. But those, as they give security
against the enemy, so when there is none, they disturb the
enjoying of peace, by making the countries taste somewhat
of a Province. For the Gentry find a difference betwixt the
Governor's favour and disfavour; and the soldiers often
commit insolences upon the people.</p>

<p>The Governments there, are so well disposed by the King,
as no Governor hath means to give over a Province into the
enemy's hands; the commands thereof are so scattered. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the Governor commands the country, and, for the most part,
the chief town: then there is a Lieutenant to the King, not
to him! of the same; and betwixt these two there is ever
jealousy nourished. Then hath every town and fortress
particular Governors, which are not subaltern [<i>subordinate</i>]
to that of the Province; but hold immediately from the
Prince: and many times the Town hath one Governor, and
the Castle another.</p>

<p>The advantages of the Governors, besides their pay from the
King, are presents from the country, dead payes [<i>? pay drawn</i>
<i>for dead men</i>], making their magazines of corn and powder
more than they need, at the King's price; and, where they
stand upon the sea, overseeing of unlawful goods: thus much
in peace. In war, they are worth as much as they will exact.
Languedoc is the best, then Brittany: Provence is worth, by
all these means, to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>, 20,000 crowns
[<i>= &pound;6,000 or about &pound;25,000 in present value</i>] a year; but
Provence only, he holds without a Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Concerning the Civil Justice there: it is nowhere more
corrupt or expenseful. The corruptness of it proceeds, First,
by reason that the King sells the places of justice at as high
a rate as can honestly be made of them: so that all thriving
is left to corruption; and the gain the King hath that way,
tempts him to make a multitude of officers, which are
another burden to the subject. Secondly, the Presidents
are not bound to judge according to the written Law, but
according to the equity drawn out of it; which liberty doth
not so much admit Conscience, as leave Wit without limits.
The expensefulness of it ariseth from the multitude of laws,
and multiplicity of forms of processes; the which too doth
beget doubt, and make them long in resolving. And all this
<i>chicanery</i>, as they call it, was brought into France from
Rome, upon the Popes coming to reside at Avignon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the strength of France. It is at this day, the greatest
united force of Christendom. The particulars in which it
consists, are these. The shape of the country; which being
round, no one part is far from succouring another. The
multitude of good towns and places of strength therein are
able to stay an army, if not to waste it; as Metz did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Emperor's. The mass of treasure which the King hath in
the Bastille. The number of arsenals distributed upon the
frontiers, besides that of Paris: all which are full of good
arms and artillery. And for ready men, the five Regiments
bestowed up and down in garrisons, together with the 2,000
of the Guard [and] the troops of Ordinary and Light Horse:
all ever in pay. Besides their Gentry, all bred soldiers; of
which they think there are, at this present, 50,000 fit to bear
arms. And to command all these, they have, at this day,
the best Generals of Christendom; which were the only
commodity the Civil Wars did leave them.</p>

<p>The weaknesses of it are, First, the want of a sufficient
Infantry, which proceeds from the ill distribution of their
wealth: for the peasant having no share allowed him, is
heartless and feeble; and consequently unserviceable for all
military uses. By reason of which, they are, first, forced to
borrow aid of the Switzers at a great charge; and secondly,
to compose their armies, for the most part, of Gentlemen:
which makes the loss of a battle there almost irrecoverable.
The Second, is the unproportionable part of the land
which the Church holds, all which is likewise dead to
military uses: for as they say there, "The Church will
lose nothing, nor defend nothing." The Third, is the want
of a competent number of ships and galleys: by reason of
which defect, first, the Spaniard overmasters them upon
the Mediterranean, and the English and Hollander upon the
Ocean; and secondly, it renders them poor in foreign trade;
so that, all the great actions of Christendom for these fifty
years having been bent upon the [<i>West</i>] Indies, they, only, have
sat idle. The Fourth, is the weakness of their frontiers: which
is so much the more dangerous because they are possessed,
all but the Ocean, by the Spaniard; for Savoy hath been
always as his own, for all uses against France. The Last, is
the difference of religion among themselves; which will ever
yield matter of civil dissension, and consequently cause the
weaker to stand in need of foreign succours.</p>

<p>The ordinary revenue of the King is, as they say now,
some 14,000,000 of crowns [<i>= &pound;4,200,000 sterling, or in</i>
<i>present value, about &pound;18,000,000</i>]; which arise principally from
the domains of the Crown, the <i>gabel</i> of salt, tallies [<i>taxes</i>]
upon the country, customs upon the merchandise, sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
offices, the yearly tithe of all that belongs to the Church, the
rising and falling of money, fines and confiscations cast upon
him by the law: but as for Wardships, they are only known
in Normandy.</p>

<p>His expense is, chiefly, Ambassadors, munition, building,
fortifying, and maintaining of galleys, (as for ships when he
needs them, he makes an embarque [<i>embargo</i>]); in pay for
soldiers, wages for officers, pensions at home and abroad;
upon the entertaining his House, his State, and his private
pleasures. And all the first, but the domains, were granted
in the beginning upon some urgent occasion; and afterwards
by Kings made perpetual, the occasion ceasing: and the
domains themselves granted because the King should live
upon his own without oppressing his subjects. But at
this day, though the revenue be thus great, and the taxes
unsupportable; yet do they little more than serve for
necessary public uses. For the King of Spain's greatness
and neighbourhood forceth the King there to live continually
upon his guard: and the treasure which the
Spaniard receives from his Indies, constrains him to raise
his revenue thus by taxes, so to be able, in some proportion,
to bear up against him; for fear, else, he should be bought
out of all his confederates and servants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the relation of this State to others. It is first to be
considered that this part of Christendom is balanced betwixt
the three Kings of Spain, France, and England; as the other
part [is] betwixt the Russian, the Kings of Poland, Sweden,
and Denmark. For as for Germany, which if it were entirely
subject to one Monarchy, would be terrible to all the rest: so
being divided betwixt so many Princes and those of so equal
power, it serves only to balance itself, and entertain easy
war with the Turk; while the Persian withholds him in a
greater. And every one of those first three hath his particular
strength, and his particular weakness. Spain hath the
advantage of both the rest in treasure, but is defective in
men: his dominions are scattered and the conveyance of his
treasure from the Indies lies obnoxious to [<i>at the mercy of</i>]
the power of any nation that is stronger by sea. France
abounds with men, lies close together, and hath money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
sufficiently. England, being an island, is hard to be invaded,
abounds with men, but wants money to employ them. For
their particular [<i>several</i>] weakness, Spain is to be kept busy in
the Low Countries, France to be afflicted with the Protestants,
and England, in Ireland. England is not able to subsist against
any [<i>either</i>] of the other [two] hand in hand; but joined with
the Low Countries it can give law to both by sea: joined
with either of them two, it is able to oppress the third, as
<span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span> did.</p>

<p>Now the only entire body in Christendom that makes head
against the Spanish Monarchy is France: and therefore they
say in France, that, "The day of the ruin of France is the eve
of the ruin of England." And thereupon England hath ever,
since the Spanish greatness, inclined rather to maintain
France, rather than to ruin it: as when King <span class="smcap">Francis [I.]</span>
was taken prisoner, the King of England lent money towards
the payment of his ransom; and the late Queen [<i><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span></i>],
when the Leaguers, after the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>'s death, had a
design to Cantonize France, though offered a part of that country,
would not consent. So then, this reason of State, of mutual
preservation, conjoining them; England may be accounted a
sure confederate of France; and Holland, by reason it partly
subsists by it; the Protestant Princes of Germany, because
they have countenance from it, against the house of Austria;
the Protestant Switzers, for religion and money; and the
Venetians, for protection against the Spaniard in Italy. So
that all their [<i>the French's</i>] friends are either Protestants or
inclining thereto; and whosoever is extremely Catholic is
their enemy, and factor for the Spanish Monarchy: as the
Pope and Cardinals, for the most part; and totally, the
Jesuits, the Catholic Princes of Germany, and the Catholics
of England and Ireland. For the Jesuits, which are the
Ecclesiastical Strength of Christendom, France&mdash;notwithstanding
the many late obligations&mdash;hath cause to despair of
them. For they intending as "one Pope, so one King" to
suppress the Protestants; and for the better support of
Christendom against the Turks: and seeing Spain the likelier
to bring this to pass, they follow the nearer probability of
effecting their end.</p>

<p>No addition could make France so dangerous to us, as that
of our Low Countries; for so it were worse, than if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Spaniard himself had them entirely. As for their hopes of
regaining Italy; it concerns the Spaniard immediately, rather
than us.</p>

<p>Concerning the state of the Protestants in France. During
peace, they are protected by their Edict [<i>of Nantes</i>]. For
their two Agents at Court defend the general from wrong;
and their <i>chambres impartis</i> every particular person. And if
troubles should arise, some scattered particulars might be in
danger; but the main body is safe. Safe to defend themselves,
though all France join against them! and if it break out into
factions, the safest; because they are both ready and united.</p>

<p>The particulars of their strength are, First, their Towns
of Surety, two of which command the river of the Loire.
Secondly, their situation. The greatest part of them lying
near together, as Poitou, Saintonge, High [<i>Upper</i>] Gascony,
Languedoc, and Dauphiny: near the sea, so consequently fit
to receive succours from abroad; and remote from Paris, so
that the quality of an army is much wasted, before it can
approach them. The Third, is the sufficiency of their present
Governors, <span class="smcap">Boulogne</span> and <span class="smcap">Desdeguiers</span>, and other second
Commanders. And for the Princes of the Blood, whom the
rest may, in shew, without emulation, obey; when they come
once to open action, those which want a party, will quickly
seek them. The Last, is the aid they are sure of from
foreign Princes; for whosoever are friends to France in
general, are more particularly their friends: and besides, the
Protestant party being grown stronger of late, as the Low
Countries; and more united, as England and Scotland, part
of that strength reflects upon them. And even the King of
Spain himself, who is [the] enemy of France in general, would
rather give them succour than see them utterly extirpated.
For as soon as they get an Edict with better conditions, they
turn head against him that now succoured them; as they did
against us, at Newhaven [<i>H&acirc;vre in 1562</i>].</p>

<p>Concerning the proportion of their number, they are not
above the Seventeenth or Eighteenth part of the People: but
of the Gentlemen, there are 6,000 of the [Protestant] Religion.
But since the peace [<i>? in 1602</i>] they have increased in
People, as principally in Paris, Normandy, and Dauphiny,
but lost in the Gentry: which loss cometh to pass by reason
that the King when he finds any Gentleman that will but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
hearken, he tempts him with preferment; and those that
he finds utterly obstinate, he suppresseth. And by such
means, he hath done them more harm in peace; than both
his predecessors in war. For in all their Assemblies, he
corrupts some of their Ministers to betray the counsel in
hand. Of the 106,000 crowns [<i>= &pound;31,800, or in present value</i>
<i>&pound;140,000</i>] a year which he pays the Protestants to entertain
their Ministers and pay their garrisons, he hath gotten the
bestowing of 16,000 of them, upon what gentleman of the
[Protestant] Religion he pleaseth; whom by that means he
moderates, if not gains. And besides, they were wont to
impose upon him their two Deputies, which are to stay at
Court: but now he makes them propose six, out of which he
chooseth the two, and by that, obligeth those; and yet notwithstanding
all this, in some occasions he makes good use
of them too. For as towards England, he placeth none in
any place of strength but firm Catholics; so towards Spain
and Savoy, he often gives charge to Protestants, as to <span class="smcap">La</span>
<span class="smcap">Force</span> in Bearn, <span class="smcap">Desdeguiers</span> and <span class="smcap">Boisse</span> in Bresse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concerning the King himself. He is a person wonderful,
both in war and peace. For his acts in War, he hath
manumized [<i>manumitted</i>] France from the Spaniard: and subdued
the League, being the most dangerous plot that hath
been laid; weakening it by Arms, but utterly dissolving it by
Wit. That is, by letting the Duke of <span class="smcap">Guise</span> out of prison, and
capitulating with the heads of it, every one apart; by which
means, he hath yet left a continual hatred among them.
Because every one sought by preventing [<i>anticipating</i>] other,
to make his conditions the better. So that now there remains
little connection of it, amongst the Gentry: only there continue
some dregs still among the Priests, and consequently
the People; especially when they are angered with the increase
and prosperity of the Protestants.</p>

<p>For his acts of Peace. He hath enriched France with a
greater proportion of wool and silk, erected goodly buildings,
cut passages [<i>canals</i>] betwixt river and river, and is about to
do the same betwixt sea and sea, redeemed much of the
mortgaged domains of the Crown, better husbanded the
money (which was wont to be drunk up, two parts of it, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
officers' hands), got aforehand in treasure, arms, and munition,
increased the infantry and suppressed the unproportionable
cavalry, and left nothing undone but the building of a navy.</p>

<p>And all this may be attributed to himself, only: because in
a Monarchy, officers are active or careless, as the Prince is
able to judge and distinguish of their labours; and withal to
participate of them somewhat, himself.</p>

<p>Sure it is, that the peace of France, and somewhat that of
Christendom itself, is secured by this Prince's life. For all
titles and discontents, all factions of religion there suppress
themselves till his death: but what will ensue afterwards?
What the rest of the House of <span class="smcap">Bourbon</span> will enterprise upon
the King's children? What the House of <span class="smcap">Guise</span>, upon that
of <span class="smcap">Bourbon</span>? What the League? What the Protestants?
What the Kings of Spain and England, if they see a breach
made by civil dissension? I choose rather to expect, than
conjecture! Because GOD hath so many ways to turn aside
from human foresight; as He gave us a testimony upon the
death of our late Queen [<i><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span></i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This country of France, considering the quantity, is the
fairest and richest of all Christendom; and contains in it,
most of the countries adjoining. For Picardy, Normandy,
and Brittany resemble England; Languedoc, Spain;
Provence, Italy; and the rest is France.</p>

<p>Besides, all the rivers that pass through it, end in it. It
abounds with corn, wine, and salt, and hath a competency of
silk; but is defective in wool, leather, metals, and horses:
and hath but few very good havens, especially on the north
side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concerning the people. Their children, at first sight,
seem men, and their men, children; but whoso, in negotiating,
presumes upon appearances shall be deceived! compassionate
towards their own nation and country; loving to
the Prince, and so they may have liberty in ceremony and
free access to him, they will be better content that he shall
be absolute in matter of substance: impatient of peace any
longer than while they are in recovering the ruins of war:
the presentness [<i>presence</i>] of danger inflames their courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
but any expectation makes it languish. For the most part,
they are all Imagination and no Judgement; but those that
prove solid, excel!</p>

<p>Their Gentlemen are all good outward men, good
Courtiers, good soldiers, and knowing enough in men and
business; but merely [<i>simply</i>] ignorant in matters of Letters,
because at fifteen they quit books and begin to live in the
world: when indeed a mediocrity [<i>medium</i>] betwixt their
form of education and ours, would do better than either. No
men stand more punctually [<i>punctiliously</i>] upon their honour
in matter of valour; and, which is strange, in nothing
else: for otherwise, in their conversation, the custom, and
shifting, and over-speaking, hath quite overcome the shame
of it.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Noble</span> Britons! Forasmuch as it hath
pleased the Almighty GOD to make us a
happy Nation, by blessing and enriching this
noble Kingdom with the sweet dew of His
heavenly Word truly and plentifully preached
amongst us; and also in situating our
country in a most wholesome climate, and
stored with many rich and pleasant treasures
for our benefit, which also yieldeth in abundance all
things necessary, so that we do not only excel other nations
in strength and courage, but also all other kingdoms far
remote are by our English Commodities relieved and cherished:
it seemeth also that the wisdom of our gracious GOD hath
reserved us, as some precious gem, unto Himself; in environing
our country with the plenteous ocean sea, and dividing
of us from the whole Continent of the rest of the inferior
world by our rich and commodious element of water, which
in due seasons, yieldeth to us in abundance. For although
our champion [<i>champagne</i>] soil, by the diligence of the
husbandman, be plentiful unto us; yet doth these watery
regions and dominions yield yearly great variety of all kind
of most wholesome and dainty fishes: so that it may seem
strange and disputable, and hard to determine, which of His
Majesty's Dominions, of the Land or Seas, be richer? Myself
being the most unworthiest of all, in that I am no scholar,
but born a fisherman's son by the seaside, and spending my
youthful time at sea about fisher [<i>fishing</i>] affairs, whereby
now I am more skilful in nets, lines, and hooks, than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
rhetoric, logic, or learned books: yet in those few which I
have read, besides the instinct of Nature, which maketh me
to know that every one should endeavour himself (the best he
is able) to be beneficial and profitable to the kingdom and
common wealth wherein he is born; which was a forcible
motive to incite me to think of this present Discourse, the
penning whereof was thus occasioned.</p>

<p>It was my fortune, some two years past [<i>i.e., in 1611</i>], to be
sent for into the company of one Master <span class="smcap">John Keymar</span>, who
is a man very well deserving of his country; and he, knowing
me to have experience in fisher [<i>fishing</i>] affairs, demanded of
me the Charge both of Busses and Line-boats, after the
Hollanders' fashion: and showed unto me some few notes
that he had gathered and gotten from other men of my trade,
which he seemed greatly to esteem of, for that himself was
altogether unexperimented in such business. And further I
delivered to him certain principal notes which he seemed
greatly to esteem; for that, he said, that "He did mind to
show them unto the right honourable Council."</p>

<p>Whereupon I entered into the cogitation of writing this True
Relation out of my own experience and knowledge, touching the
inestimable sums of money taken yearly for fish and herrings
out of His Majesty's seas by strangers. Whereby they have not
only maintained their wars against the Spaniard, both by land
and sea, he being one of the great Monarchs of the world;
and at length they have not only wearied him in the wars
and brought him to good terms and reasonable Composition:
but also, it is most apparent, notwithstanding the huge charge
of their wars, so long continued, which would have made
any other nation poor and beggarly; they, to the contrary,
are grown exceeding rich and strong in fortified towns and
beautiful buildings, in plenty of money and gold, in trade
and traffic with all other nations, and have so increased and
multiplied their shipping and mariners, that all other nations
and countries in the world do admire [<i>wonder at</i>] them.</p>

<p>Moreover, whereas one haven in one of their towns did, in
former times, contain their ships and shipping; with infinite
cost, now they have cut out two havens more to a town:
and at this present, are all three havens scarce sufficient with
room enough to contain their ships and shipping. And by
reason of their industrious fisher-trade, not one of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
people is idle, nor none seen to beg amongst them, except
they be some of our own English nation.</p>

<p>And what their chiefest trade is, or the principal Gold
Mine, is well known to all merchants that have used those
parts, and to myself and all fishermen: namely, that His
Majesty's Seas are their chiefest, principal, and only rich
Treasury; whereby they have so long time maintained their
wars, and have so greatly prospered and enriched themselves.</p>

<p>If that their little country of the United Provinces can do
this (as is most manifest before our eyes they do), then what
may we His Majesty's subjects do, if this trade of fishing
were once erected among us? We having in our own
countries [<i>counties</i>], sufficient store of all necessaries to accomplish
the like business.</p>

<p>For the Hollanders have nothing growing in their own
land for that business; but they are compelled to fetch
all their wood, timber, and plank, wherewith they build
and make all their ships of, out of divers countries: their
iron out of other places; their hemp and cordage out of
the Eastern [<i>Baltic</i>] Countries; the hoops and barrel-boards
out of Norway and Sprucia [<i>Prussia</i>]; their bread-corn out of
Poland and the East Parts; their malt, barley, and best
Double Drink from England; and also all their fish and
chiefest wealth out of His Majesty's seas.</p>

<p>The which they do transport unto the foresaid countries;
and return for the procedue [<i>proceeds</i>] of fish and herrings, the
forenamed commodities: whereby their ships and mariners
are set on work, and continually multiplied; and into their
countries is plentiful store of money and gold daily brought,
only [<i>solely</i>] for the sales of fish and herrings.</p>

<p>And their country being, as it were, a small plot of ground
in comparison of Great Britain; for two of His Majesty's
counties, Suffolk and Norfolk, do equal, if not exceed, in
spaciousness, all their Provinces: and yet it is manifest, that
for shipping and seafaring men, all England, Scotland,
France, and Spain, for quantity of shipping and fishermen,
cannot make so great a number.</p>

<p>Howsoever this may seem strange unto many that do not
know it; yet do I assure myself, that a great number besides
myself, know I affirm nothing herein but the truth. Wherefore
seeing the great benefit that this business by the Busses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
bonadventures, or fisherships; by erecting of this profitable
and new trade, which will bring plenty unto His Majesty's
Kingdoms and be for the general good of the Common wealth;
in setting of many thousands of poor people on work, which now
know not how to live; and also for the increasing of ships and
fishermen, which shall be employed about the taking of fish
and herrings out of His Majesty's own streams; and also for
the employing of ships, and increasing of mariners for the
strengthening of the Kingdom against all foreign invasions;
and for the enriching of Merchants with transportation of
fish and herrings into other countries; and also for the
bringing in of gold and money: which now is grown but
scarce, by reason that the Dutch and Hollanders have so long
time been suffered to carry away our money and best gold for
fish and herrings taken out of His Majesty's own streams;
which His Majesty's own subjects do want and still are like[ly]
to do, if that they be not forbidden for bringing us fish and
herrings; and this worthy common wealth's business of
Busses fostered and furthered by His Majesty's honourable
Council, and the worshipful and wealthy subjects; by putting
to their helping Adventures now at the first, for that those
that be now the fishermen, of themselves be not able to begin.</p>

<p>Those poor boats and sorry nets that our fishermen of
England now have, are all their chiefest wealth; but were
their ability better, they would soon be employing themselves:
for that it is certain that all the fishermen of England do
rejoice now at the very name and news of building of Busses,
with a most joyful applaud, praying to GOD to further it!
for what great profit and pleasure it will bring they do well
understand, and I will hereafter declare.</p>

<p>First, I shall not need to prove that it is lawful for us that
be His Majesty's own subjects, to take with all diligence
the blessings that Almighty GOD doth yearly send unto us,
at their due times and seasons; and which do offer themselves
freely and abundantly to us, in our own seas and
nigh our own shores.</p>

<p>Secondly, to prove that it is feasible for us; for what can be
more plain than that we see daily done before our eyes by
the Hollanders! that have nothing that they use, growing in
their own land, but are constrained to fetch all out of other
countries: whereas we have all things that shall be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
about that business growing at home in our own land; pitch
and tar only excepted.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to prove it will be profitable, no man need to
doubt; for that we see the Hollanders have long maintained
their wars: and are nevertheless grown exceeding rich: which
are things to be admired, insomuch that themselves do call it
their <i>chiefest trade, and principal Gold Mine; whereby many</i>
<i>thousands of their people of trades and occupations be set on work,</i>
<i>well maintained, and do prosper</i>. These be the Hollanders' own
words in a Dutch Proclamation, and translated into English;
and the copy of that Proclamation is here annexed unto the
end of my book [<i>see p.</i> 350].</p>

<p>And shall we neglect so great blessings! O slothful
England, and careless countrymen! look but on these fellows,
that we call the plump Hollanders! Behold their diligence
in fishing! and our own careless negligence!</p>

<p>In the midst of the month of May, do the industrious
Hollanders begin to make ready their Busses and fisher-fleets;
and by the first of their June [<i>i.e., N.S.</i>] are they yearly
ready, and seen to sail out of the Maas, the Texel, and the
Vlie, a thousand Sail together; for to catch herrings in the
North seas.</p>

<p>Six hundred of these fisherships and more, be great Busses
some six score tons, most of them be a hundred tons, and the
rest three score tons, and fifty tons: the biggest of them
having four and twenty men; some twenty men, and some
eighteen, and sixteen men a piece. So that there cannot be
in this Fleet of People, no less than twenty thousand sailors.</p>

<p>These having with them bread, butter, and Holland cheese
for their provision, do daily get their other diet out of His
Majesty's seas; besides the lading of this Fleet three times a
piece commonly before Saint Andrew['s day, <i>October 24</i>] with
herrings, which being sold by them but at the rate of Ten
Pounds the Last, amounteth unto much more than the sum
of one million of pounds [= &pound;4,500,000 <i>in present value</i>]
sterling; only [<i>solely</i>] by this fleet of Busses yearly. No King
upon the earth did ever see such a fleet of his own subjects
at any time; and yet this Fleet is, there and then, yearly to
be seen. A most worthy sight it were, if they were my own
countrymen; yet have I taken pleasure in being amongst them,
to behold the neatness of their ships and fishermen, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
every man knoweth his own place, and all labouring merrily
together: whereby the poorest sort of themselves, their wives
and children, be well maintained; and no want seen amongst
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shetland is the
greatest Isle of
all the Oreades,
and lieth in the
height of 60&deg;
N. Lat.</div>

<p>And thus North-West-and-by-North hence along they steer,
then being the very heart of summer and the very yolk of all
the year, sailing until they do come unto the Isle of Shetland,
which is His Majesty's dominions. And
with this gallant fleet of Busses, there have been
seen twenty, thirty, and forty ships of war to waft
[<i>convoy</i>] and guard them from being pillaged and
taken by their enemies and Dunkirkers: but now the wars
be ended, they do save that great charge, for they have not
now about four or six to look unto them, for [<i>from</i>] being
spoiled by rovers and pirates.</p>

<p>Now if that it happen that they have so good a wind as to be
at Shetland before the 14th day of their June [<i>i.e., N.S.</i>] as most
commonly they have, then do they all put into Shetland, nigh
Swinborough [<i>Sumburgh</i>] Head; into a sound called Bracies
[<i>Bressa</i>] Sound, and there they frolic it on land, until that
they have sucked out all the marrow of the malt and good
Scotch ale, which is the best liquor that the island doth
afford: but the 14th day of June being once come, then away
all of them go, for that is the first day, by their own law,
before which time they must not lay a net; for until then the
herrings be not in season, nor fit to be taken to be salted.</p>

<p>From this place, being nigh two hundred leagues from
Yarmouth, do they now first begin to fish, and they do never
leave the shoals of herrings, but come along amongst them,
following the herrings as they do come, five hundred miles in
length [<i>along</i>], and lading their ships twice or thrice before
they come to Yarmouth, with the principal and best herrings,
and sending them away by the merchant ships that cometh
unto them, that bringeth them victuals, barrels, and more salt,
and nets if that they do need any, the which ships that buyeth
their herrings they do call Herring Yagers [<i>now spelt</i> Jagers]:
and these Yagers carry them, and sell them in the East
[<i>Baltic</i>] Countries, some to Revel and to Riga, and some so far
as Narva and Russia, Stockholm in Sweden, Quinsborough
[? <i>Konigsberg</i>], Dantsic, and Elving [<i>Elbing</i>], and all Poland,
Sprucia, and Pomerland, Letto [<i>Lithuania</i>], Burnt-Hollume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Stettin, Lubeck, and Jutland and Denmark. Returning hemp,
flax, cordage, cables, and iron; corn, soap ashes, wax, wainscot,
clapholt [? <i>clap-boards</i>], pitch, tar, masts, and spruce
deals, hoops and barrel-boards [<i>staves</i>]; and plenty of silver
and gold: only [<i>solely</i>] for their procedue [<i>proceeds</i>] of herrings.</p>

<p>Now besides this great Fleet of the Busses, the Hollanders
have a huge number more of smaller burden, only for to take
herrings also; and these be of the burden from fifty tons unto
thirty tons, and twenty tons. The greatest of them have
twelve men a piece, and the smallest eight and nine men a
piece; and these are vessels of divers fashions and not like
unto the Busses, yet go they only for herrings in the season,
and they be called, some of them, Sword-Pinks, Flat-Bottoms,
Holland-Toads, Crab-Skuits, and Yevers: and all these, or the
most part do go to Shetland; but these have no Yagers to
come unto them; but they go themselves home when they be
laden, or else unto the best market. There have been seen
and numbered of Busses and these, in braces [<i>rigged</i>], sound,
and going out to sea; and at sea in sight at one time, two
thousand Sail, besides them that were at sea without [<i>out of</i>]
sight, which could not be numbered.</p>

<p>It is Bartholomewtide [<i>August 24</i>] yearly, before that they
be come from Shetland with the herrings so high as [<i>down to</i>]
Yarmouth: and all those herrings that they do catch in the
Yarmouth seas from Bartholomewtide until Saint Andrew['s
day, <i>October 24</i>], the worst that be, the roope-sick herrings that
will not serve to make barrelled herrings by their own law,
they must not bring home into Holland; wherefore they do
sell them for ready money or gold unto the Yarmouth men,
that be no fishermen, but merchants and engrossers of great
quantities of herrings, if that, by any means, they can get them.
So that the Hollanders be very welcome guests unto the
Yarmouthian [!] herring-buyers, and the Hollanders do call
them their "hosts," and they do yearly carry away from
Yarmouth many a thousand pounds, as it is well known.</p>

<p>But these Hollanders, with the ladings of the best, which
they make their best brand herrings to serve for Lenten store,
they send some for Bordeaux, some for Rochelle, Nantes,
Morlaix; and Saint Malo and Caen in Normandy; Rouen,
Paris, Amiens, and all Picardy and Calais: and they do
return from these places wines, salt, feathers, rosin, woad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Normandy canvas, and Dowlais cloth, and money and French
crowns. But out of all the Archduke's countries they return
nothing from thence but ready money, in my own knowledge;
and their ready payment was all double Jacobuses, English
twenty-[five] shilling pieces. I have seen more there, in one
day, than ever I did in London at any time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I have seen a
small haddock
sold there for
two shillings
[and] sixpence:
and a turbot
for a Jacobus.</div>

<p>For at Ostend, Newport, and Dunkirk, where and when
the Holland Pinks cometh in, there daily the Merchants,
that be but women (but not such women as the fishwives of
Billingsgate; for these Netherland women do lade away
many waggons with fresh fish daily, some for Bruges, and
some for Brussels, Yperen, Dixmuiden, and Rissels [<i>Lille</i>],
and at Sas by Ghent), I have seen these Women-Merchants
have their aprons full of nothing but English Jacobuses, to
make all their payment of; and such heaps and budgetfuls
in the counting-houses of the Fish Brokers, which made me
much to wonder how they should come by them. And
also I know that capons are not so dearly sold
by the poulterers in Gratious [<i>Gracechurch</i>] Street
in London, as fresh fish is sold by the Hollanders
in all those Roman Catholic and Papistical
countries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And whereas I have made but a true relation of their Fleets
of Busses, and only the herring fishermen that be on His
Majesty's seas from June until November: I will here set
down the fishermen that, all the year long, in the seasons, do
fish for Cod and Ling continually, going and returning laden
with barrelled fish.</p>

<p>And these be Pinks and Well-boats of the burden of forty
tons, and the smallest thirty tons. These have some twelve
men a piece, one with another. There is of this sort of fisherboats,
beginning at Flushing, Camefere, Surwick Sea, the
Maas, the Texel, and the Vlie, and the other sandy islands,
about five hundred or six hundred Sail which, all the year
long, are fishing for Cod; whereof they do make their barrelled
fish, which they do transport in the summer into the East
parts, but in winter all France is served by them and all the
Archduke's countries before spoken of: both of barrelled fish
and fresh fish, which they of purpose do keep alive in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
boats in wells. And to us here in England, for love of our
strong beer, they bring us barrelled fish in winter; and carry
away our money and gold every day in great quantities.</p>

<p>Besides all these Pinks and Well-boats, the Hollanders
have continually, in the season, another fleet of fishermen,
at the north-east head of Shetland, which be of another
quality: and there are more than two hundred of these, and
these be called Fly-boats. These do ride at anchor all the
season at Shetland, in the fishing grounds, and they have
small boats within them, which be like unto Cobles, the
which they do put out to lay and haul their lines, whereby
they do take great store of Ling: the which they do not
barrel, but split them and salt them in the ship's bulk [<i>hold</i>];
and these they sell commonly for four and five pounds the
hundred. These go by the name of Holland Lings: but
they are taken out of His Majesty's seas, and were Shetland
Lings before they took them there; and for these Lings they
do carry away abundance of England's best money daily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/335n.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Now</span> having declared according unto truth, the
numbers of their fishermen in Holland for herrings
upon His Majesty's seas; and also of their Pinks
and Well-boats; and their courses for taking,
venting, and selling of their barrelled fish and
fresh fish; and also of their Fly-boats at the north-east
head of Shetland, for Shetland Lings: I think it now best,
truly to show the true number of our English fishermen, and
how they do employ themselves all the year long; first
beginning at Colchester, nigh the mouth of the Thames, and
so proceeding northward.</p>

<p>I can scarce afford these men of that Water the name of
fishermen; for that their chiefest trade is dredging for oysters:
yet have they, in the summer, some eight or ten boats in the
North seas for Cod; which if that they happen to spend all
their salt, and to speed well, they may get some twenty pounds
in a summer clear.</p>

<p>But here, by the way, I will make known a great abuse
that is offered to the common wealth, and especially to all
the herring fishermen of England, only by those men of
Colchester Water. For these men, from Saint Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
[<i>October 24</i>] until Candlemas [<i>February 2</i>], and sometimes
longer, do set forth Stale-boats, amongst the sands in the
Thames' mouth, for to take sprats, with great stale-nets,
with a great poke [<i>bag</i>]; and they standing in the Swinne
or the King's Channel on the back of the Gunfleet, they do
there take instead of sprats, infinite thousands of young
herrings, smaller than sprats and not good to be eaten, for
one sprat is better worth than twenty of those Bleaks or
young herrings. But because they do fill the bushel at
Billingsgate, where they do sell them for sprats; the which,
if that they were let [a]live, would all be, at Midsummer, a
fat Summer full Herring. And a peck is sometimes there
sold for twopence; which number of herrings at Midsummer
would make a barrel of summer herrings, worth twenty or
thirty shillings.</p>

<p>If that they could take sprats it were good, for they be
good victuals for the City; but for every cartload or bushel
of sprats, they take a hundred cartloads or bushels of these
young herrings; which be the very spawn of the shoals of the
herrings that cometh from Shetland every summer: and
whereas they come into Yarmouth seas yearly about Saint
Luke's [day, <i>September 21</i>] and (sometimes before, if that it
do blow a hard easterly wind) do always at that season
become roope-sick and do spawn and become shotten [<i>empty</i>]
betwixt Wintertonness and Orfordness. And those fry of that
spawn, those young little creatures, by the wisdom of the
great Creator, seeketh into the shore and shallow places,
there to be nourished, and also into the Thames' mouth into
the sweetest waters; for that the water nigh the shore and
in the Thames' mouth is not so briny salt as it is farther off
in the deep water. Where these Bleaks yearly seeking to be
nourished, they be always at that season taken and destroyed.
But if that these men will needs use their Stale-boats and
nets, let them go where the good sprats be. They must then
stand at Orfordness and in Dunwich bay, where there be
excellent sprats: and for the good of all the herring fishermen
of England, I wish that they might be prohibited to sell that
which is not wholesome to be eaten; which is as much as to
sell hemlock for parsnips.</p>

<p>The next to Colchester, is Harwich Water. A royal harbour
and a proper town, fit for the use of Busses (no place in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Holland comparable to it, for there is both land and strand
and dry beach enough for four hundred Sail); but the chiefest
trade of the inhabitants of this place is with Caravels for
Newcastle coals: but they have three or four ships yearly
that they do send to Iceland for Cod and Ling from March
until September; and some years they get, and some years
they lose. But if that they had but once the trade of Busses,
this would soon be a fine place: but those Caravels and Ships
which they now have, be all their chiefest wealth.</p>

<p>Six miles up Harwich water stands Ipswich; which is a gallant
town and rich. This Town is such a place for the Busses,
as in all England and Holland I know no place so convenient.
First, it is the best place in all England for the building of
Busses; both for the plenty of timber and plank, and
excellent workmen for making of ships. There are more
there, than there are in six of the best towns in all England.
Secondly, it is a principal place for good housewives for
spinning of yarn, for the making of pouldavice [<i>canvas</i>]; for
there is the best that is made. Which town with the use
of the making of twine, will soon be the best place of all
England for to provide nets for the Busses. It is also a most
convenient place for the wintering of the Busses, for that all
the shores of that river are altogether ooze and soft ground,
fit for them to lie on in winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This Town is
most fit and
convenient
place to make
a Staple Town
for corn for all
England, for
the return and
sale of the
Busses'
herrings from
Dantsic and
Poland.</div>

<p>Also the Ipswich men be the chiefest Merchant Adventurers
of all England, for all the East Lands [<i>Baltic</i>
<i>Countries</i>], for the Suffolk cloths: and they have
their factors lying, all the year long, in all those
places where the Hollanders do vent their herrings,
and where the best price and sale is continually.
And although that yet there be no fishermen, yet
have they store of seafaring men, and for Masters
for the Busses, they may have enough from Yarmouth
and So[uth]w[o]ld and the sea-coast towns [<i>villages</i>]
down their river. From Nacton and Chimton, Holbroke,
Shotley, and Cowlness they may get men that will soon be
good fishermen with but little use. For understand thus
much! that there is a kind of emulation in Holland between
the fishermen that go to sea in Pinks and Line-boats, winter
and summer; and those fishermen that go in the Busses.
For they in the Pinks make a scorn of them in the Busses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and do call them <i>koe-milkens</i> or "cow-milkers": for indeed the
most part of them be men of occupations [<i>handicraftsmen</i>] in
winter, or else countrymen; and do milk the cows themselves
and make all the Holland cheese, when they be at home.</p>

<p>This place is also most convenient for the erecting of salt-pans,
for the making of "Salt upon Salt." For that the
harbour is so good that, at all times, ships may come unto
them with salt from Mayo, or Spanish salt, to make brine or
pickle; and also the Caravels from Newcastle with coals for
the boiling of it at the cheapest rates, at any time may come
thither.</p>

<p>To the north-east of this place, three or four leagues, is
Orford Haven; and in the towns of Orford and Aldborough
especially be many good fishermen. And there are belonging
to those towns some forty or fifty North Sea boats, that
yearly go to sea, having seven men a piece; and ten or twelve
Iceland barks, which sometimes get something, and sometimes
little or nothing. If that these men's wealth were in
Busses and nets, and had but once the trade, they would put
down the Hollander! for they be great plyers of any voyage
that they do undertake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dunwich in
ancient times
hath been the
seat of the
Kings of the
East Angles,
but [is] now
all ruined.</div>

<p>About three leagues to the northward is So[uth]w[o]ld Haven,
and in the towns of So[uth]w[o]ld, Dunwich, and
Walderswick be a very good breed of fishermen; and
there are belonging unto those three towns, of North
Sea boats some twenty sail; and of Iceland barks
some fifty sail, which yearly they send for Cod and
Ling to Iceland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">My father lived
in this town
until he was 98
years of age,
and gave these

years unto four
Princes, viz.
King <span class="smcap">Edward</span>,
Queen <span class="smcap">Mary</span>,
Queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
and until the
sixth year
[1609] of the
reign of our
most gracious
Sovereign.
Which cometh
to much more
than one
thousand
pounds, for one
man of that
town.</div>

<p>This town of So[uth]w[o]ld, of a sea town, is the
most beneficial unto His Majesty, of all the towns
in England; by reason all their trade is unto
Iceland for Ling, and His Majesty's Serjeant
Caterer hath yearly gratis out of every ship and
bark, one hundred of the choicest and fairest Lings,
which be worth more than ten pound the hundred;
and they call them "Composition Fish." But these
men of this place are greatly hindered, and in a
manner undone, by reason their haven is so bad,
and in a manner often stopped up with beach and
shingle stone that the wind and tide and the sea do
beat thither, so that many time, in the season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
when they be ready to go to sea; they cannot get
out when time is to go to sea; neither can they
get in when they return from sea, but oftentimes
do cast away their goods and themselves. This haven if that
it had but a south pier built of timber, would be a far better
haven than Yarmouth haven, with one quarter of the cost
that hath been bestowed on Yarmouth haven. They be now
suitors unto His Majesty: GOD grant that they may speed!
For it is pitiful, the trouble and damage that all the men of
these three towns do daily sustain by their naughty [<i>inadequate</i>]
harbour.</p>

<p>To the northward of So[uth]w[o]ld Haven three leagues, are
Kirkley and Layestof [<i>Lowestoft</i>], decayed towns. They have
six or seven North Sea boats: but they of Lowestoft make
benefit yearly of buying of herrings of the Hollanders; for
likewise these Hollanders be "hosted" with the Lowestoft
men, as they be with the Yarmouthians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In all His
Majesty's
kingdoms, not
any town, comparable
unto it
for brave
buildings.</div>

<p>To the northward, two leagues, is the town of Great
Yarmouth, very beautifully built upon a very
pleasant and sandy plain of three miles in length.
This town is a place of great resort of all the
herring fishermen of England. For thither do
resort all the fishermen of the Cinque Ports and
the rest of the West Country men of England, as far
as Burport [<i>Bridport</i>], and Lyme [Regis] in Dorsetshire:
and those herrings that they do take they do not barrel,
because their boats be but small things, but they sell all
unto the Yarmouth herring-buyers for ready money. And
also the fishermen of the north countries, beyond Scarborough
and Robin Hood's Bay, and some as far as the Bishopric of
Durham do thither resort yearly, in poor little boats called
"Five-Men Cobbles"; and all the herrings that they do take
they do sell fresh unto the Yarmouth men, to make red
herrings.</p>

<p>Also to Yarmouth, do daily come into the haven up to the
quay, all or the most part of the great Fleet of Hollanders,
which before I made relation of, that go in the Sword-Pinks,
Holland-Toads, Crab-Skuits, Walnut-Shells, and great and
small Yevers; one hundred and two hundred sail at one time
together, and all their herrings that they do bring in, they do
sell them all, for ready money, to the Yarmouth men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>And also the Frenchmen of Picardy and Normandy, some
hundred sail of them at a time, do come thither; and all the
herrings they catch, they sell fresh unto these Herring-mongers
of Yarmouth, for ready money. So that it amounteth unto a
great sum of money, that the Hollanders and Frenchmen do
carry away from Yarmouth yearly into Holland and France:
which money doth never come again into England.</p>

<p>This town is very well governed by wise and civil [<i>prudent</i>]
Magistrates, and good orders carefully observed for the
maintenance of their Haven and Corporation. And this town,
by reason of the situation, and the fresh rivers that belong
to it, one [<i>the Wensum</i>] up to the city of Norwich; and
another [<i>the Wavency</i>] that runneth far up into Suffolk, a
butter and cheese country, about Bunga [<i>Bungay</i>] and
Betkels [<i>Beccles</i>]; and a third [<i>the Bure</i>] that runneth far up
into Flegg [<i>by Aylesham</i>] a corn country; by reason whereof
this town of Yarmouth is always well served with all kind
of provision at good and cheap rates: whereby they of the
town do relieve the strangers, and also do benefit themselves.</p>

<p>To this town belongeth some twenty Iceland barks, which
yearly they do send for Cod and Ling, and some hundred
and fifty sail of North Sea boats. They make a shift to live;
but if that they had the use of Busses and also barrelled fish,
they would excel all England and Holland. For they be
the only fishermen for North seas, and also the best for the
handling of their fish that be in all this land.</p>

<p>The herring buyers of Yarmouth doth profit more than doth
the fishermen of Yarmouth, by reason of the resort of the
Hollanders; for that they are suffered to sell all their roope-sick
herrings at Yarmouth to the Merchants there. And
also the barrelled fish that the Flemings do bring in winter
to London, Ipswich, Lynn, and Hull do also gale [<i>gaul</i>]
them: but for that [<i>seeing that</i>] our fishermen may, if they
please, make barrelled fish themselves; and therefore I will
not moan [<i>bemoan</i>] them!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yarmouth
haven is the
only refuge, in
distress of
weather, for all
the fishermen
of the Cinque
Ports and all
others that do
fish in those
seas: and it is
built all of
timber, against
the violence of
the main sea.
It is now in
great danger
to come to
ruin; if they
have not help
in time.</div>

<p>The merchant herring buyer of Yarmouth that hath a
stock of his own, so long as he can make his gains
so certain with buying of roope-sick herrings of
the Hollanders, will never lay out his money to
build or set forth Busses; and the fishermen be
now so poor, by reason that they only do bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
whole charge of that costly haven, the merchant
herring buyers being not at any charge thereof:
but all that great cost cometh out of the fishermen's
labours for the maintenance of that wooden
haven [<i>pier</i>], which amounteth to some five
hundred pounds a year, and some years more.
So that though they be willing, yet their ability
will not suffer them to do it; neither can they
forbear [<i>invest</i>] their money to adventure their herrings into
the East [<i>Baltic</i>] Countries, where the best sales always be.</p>

<p>To the northward of Yarmouth eight leagues, are the
towns of Blackney and Wells, good harbours and fit for
Busses: and they have good store of fishermen. And these
towns have some twenty Sail of barks that they do yearly
send unto Iceland. But these towns be greatly decayed, to
that they have been in times past: the which places, if that
they had but twenty Busses belonging to them, would soon
grow rich towns in short time.</p>

<p>Then is there [King's] Lynn, a proper gallant town for
seafaring men, and for men for Iceland. This is a rich
town, and they have some twenty Sail of Iceland ships, that
they yearly send for Cod and Ling: and I am in hope to see
them fall to the use of Busses as soon as any men.</p>

<p>To the northward is Boston, a proper town; and like unto
Holland's soil, for low ground and sands coming in: but yet
there are but few fishermen; but it is a most fit place for
Busses. If that they had but once the taste of them, they
would soon find good liking.</p>

<p>Next to Boston, some twenty leagues to the northward, is
the great river of Humber, wherein there is Hull, a very
proper town of sailors and shipping: but there be but few
fishermen. But it is a most convenient place for to adventure
Busses.</p>

<p>There are also Grimsby, Paul, and Patrington. In all
these places now there is great store of poor and idle people,
that know not how to live; and the most of all these places
be decayed, and the best of them all grow worse and worse:
which with the use of Busses would soon grow rich merchant
towns, as is in Holland. For to these places would be
transported of the East lands all manner of commodities for
the use of Busses; and houses and work-yards erected for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
coopers, and ropemakers, and great numbers of net-makers.
And with the recourse of the ships that shall bring salt and
other commodities, and ships that shall lade away their
herrings and fish, these places shall soon become populous;
and money stirring plentifully in these places returned for the
procedue [<i>proceeds</i>] of fish and herrings: which places now
be exceeding poor and beggarly.</p>

<p>In all these fisher towns, that I have before named,
as Colchester, Harwich, Orford, Aldborough, Dunwich,
Walderswick, So[uth]w[o]ld, Yarmouth, Blackney, Wells,
Lynn, Boston, and Hull&mdash;these be all the chiefest towns; and
all that useth the North seas in summer: and all these towns,
it is well known, be ruinated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I crave

<p>In all these towns I know to be &mdash;&mdash; Iceland barks, and &mdash;&mdash;
North Sea boats; and all these fishermen having &mdash;&mdash;

that there are in all the West Country of England

fresh fish, which seldom or never useth any salt;
say, that they have other &mdash;&mdash; men a piece which makes
the sum of &mdash;&mdash; in all England.</p>

<p>But in all these I have not reckoned the fishermen, mackerel-catchers,
nor the Cobble-men of the north country, which
having &mdash;&mdash; men a piece, cometh to &mdash;&mdash; men in all England.</p>

<p>But so many in all England, and I have truly showed
before, that the Hollander hath in one fleet of Busses, twenty
thousand fishermen; besides all them that goeth in the
Sword-Pinks, Flat-Bottoms, Crab-Skuits, Walnut-Shells, and
Great Yevers, wherein there are not less than twelve thousand
more: and all these are only for to catch herrings in the
North seas. Besides all they that go in the Fly-boats for
Shetland Ling, and the Pinks for barrelled fish, and Trammel-boats:
which cometh unto five thousand more.</p>

<p>So that it is most true, that as they have the sum of &mdash;&mdash;
fishermen more than there is in all this land: and by reason
of their Busses and Pinks and fishermen that set their
Merchant-ships on work [<i>a work</i>]; so have they &mdash;&mdash; ships and

Ipswich, Yarmouth, Lynn, Hull, or Scarborough; and there
they do sell, at good rates, the first voyage. But the second
voyage (because that they which be now the fishermen, have
not yet the right use of making of barrelled fish, wherewith
they might serve France, as do the Hollanders) they be
now constrained to sell in England. For that it is staple
[<i>standard</i>] fish; and not being barrelled, the French will not
buy it.</p>

<p>But if that our fishermen had but once the use of Pinks
and Line-boats and barrelled fish; then they might serve
France as well as the Hollanders: which by this new trade
of Busses being once erected, and Pinks, and Line-boats
after the Holland manner; there will be fishermen enough
to manage the Pinks for barrelled fish, from November unto
the beginning of May, only the most part of those men that
shall be maintained by the Busses. For that, when the Busses
do leave work, in the winter, their men shall have employment
by the Pinks for barrelled fish; which men now do little or
nothing. For this last winter at Yarmouth, there were three
hundred idle men that could get nothing to do, living very
poor for lack of employment; which most gladly would have
gone to sea in Pinks, if there had been any for them to go in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No more
English but
two ships this
year laded
there.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Note here how
the Hollanders
employ themselves
and their
Ships! First, in
taking of the
herrings quick
[<i>alive</i>]; and
yet are not
content! but
catch them
again, after
they be dead!
and do set both
their ships and
mariners on
work: and
English ships
lie up a rotting!</div>

<p>And whereas I said before, that there was not one ship set
on work by our fishermen: there may be objected against
me this. That there doth every year commonly lade at
Yarmouth four or five London ships for the Straits [<i>of</i>
<i>Gibraltar</i>], which is sometimes true. And the Yarmouth
men themselves do yearly send two or three ships to
Bordeaux, and two or three boats laden with
herrings, to Rouen, or to Nantes, or Saint Malo:
whereby there are returned salt, wines, and Normandy
canvas; whereby the King hath some custom. But
there is no <i>money</i> returned into England for these herrings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
which cost the Yarmouthians <i>ready gold</i>, before
that they had them of the Hollanders and Frenchmen
to lade these ships: and therefore I may boldly
say, Not one!</p>

<p>And this last year now the Hollanders themselves
have also gotten that trade, for there did lade
twelve sail of Holland ships with red herrings at
Yarmouth for Civita Vecchia, Leghorn, Genoa, and
Marseilles and Toulon. Most of them being ladened
by the English merchants. So that if this be
suffered, the English owners of ships shall have
but small employment for theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And I have

<p>The Hollanders do make both a profitable and a pleasant
trade of this summer fishing. For there was one of them
that having a gallant great new Buss of his own, and he
having a daughter married unto one that was his Mate in the
Buss: the Owner that was Master of this Buss did take his
wife with him aboard, and his Mate his wife; and so they
did set sail for the North seas, with the two women with
them, the mother and the daughter. Where, having a
fair wind, and being fishing in the North seas, they had soon
filled their Buss with herrings; and a Herring-Yager cometh
unto them, and brings them gold and fresh supplies, and
copeth [<i>bargaineth</i>] with them, and taketh in their herrings
for ready money, and delivereth them more barrels
and salt; and away goeth the Yager for the first
market into Sprucia [<i>Prussia</i>]. And still is the
Buss fishing at sea, and soon after again was full
laden and boone [<i>bound</i>] home: but then another
Yager cometh unto him as did the former, and delivering
them more provision of barrels, salt, and ready money, and
bids them farewell. And still the Buss lieth at sea, with
the mother and daughter, so long, and not very long before
they had again all their barrels full; and then they sailed
home into Holland, with the two women, and the buss laden
with herrings, and a thousand pounds of ready money.</p>

<p>If that any man should make question of the truth of this,
it will be very credibly approved by divers of good credit that
be now in the city of London.</p>

whereout if that you do deduct &pound;57 for the charge of setting
her to sea, there is still resting &pound;159 clear gain by one Pink,
with fifteen Last of fish, for two months.</p>

<p>Wherefore, seeing the profit so plain; and, by the grace
of GOD, so certain; both by the Busses and Line-boats,
whereby the Hollanders have so long gained by: let all
noble, worshipful, and wealthy subjects put to their
adventuring and helping hands, for the speedy launching
and floating forward of this great good common wealth
business, for the strengthening of His Majesty's dominions
with two principal pillars, which are, with plenty of coin
brought in for Fish and herrings from other nations, and also
for the increasing of mariners against all common invasions.
And also for the bettering of trades and occupations, and
setting of thousands of poor and idle people on work, which
now know not how to live; which by this Trade of Busses
shall be employed: as daily we see is done, before our eyes, by
the Hollanders. And, as always it hath been seen, that
those that be now the fishermen of England have been always
found to be sufficient to serve His Majesty's ships in former
time, when there has been employment: which fellows, by this
new trade of building and setting forth of Busses will be
greatly multiplied and increased in this land. Which fellows,
as we see the Hollanders, being well fed in fishing affairs,
and strong[er] and lustier than the sailors that use the long
southern voyages that sometimes are greatly surfeited and
hunger-pined: but these courageous, young, lusty, fed-strong
younkers, that shall be bred in the Busses, when His Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
shall have occasion for their service in war against the
enemy, will be fellows for the nonce! and will put more
strength to an iron crow at a piece of great ordnance in
traversing of a cannon or culvering, with the direction of
the experimented [<i>experienced</i>] Master Gunner, than two or
three of the forenamed surfeited sailors. And in distress of
wind-grown sea, and foul winter's weather, for flying forward
to their labour, for pulling in a topsail or a spritsail, or
shaking off a bonnet in a dark night! for wet and cold cannot
make them shrink, nor stain that the North seas and the
Busses and Pinks have dyed in the grain, for such purposes.</p>

<p>And whosoever shall go to sea for Captain to command in
martial affairs, or to take charge for Master in trade of
merchandise (as in times past I have done both) will make
choice of these fellows: for I have seen their resolution in
the face of their enemy, when they have been <i>legeramenta</i>
[Italian for <i>light-hearted</i>] and frolicsome, and as forward as
about their ordinary labours or business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is not unknown,
that
last year [1613]
there was a
general press
along the coast
of England,
from Hull in
Yorkshire unto
St. Michael's
Mount in Cornwall,
only for
sailors to furnish
but seven
ships, for the
wafting over
[<i>conveying</i>] of
the Count Palantine
and his
noble Princess
but twenty-eight
leagues.</div>

<p>And when His Majesty shall have occasion and employment
for the furnishing of his Navy, there will be
no want of Masters, Pilots, Commanders, and sufficient
directors of a course and keeping of computation;
but now there is a pitiful want of
sufficient good men to do the offices and labours
before spoken of. All which, these men of the
Busses and Pinks will worthily supply.</p>

<p>And to the art of sailing they may happily attain.
For hitherto it hath been commonly seen, that
those men that have been brought up in their
youth in fishery, have deserved as well as any in
the land for artificial [<i>scientific</i>] sailing: for at this
time is practised all the projections of circular and
mathematical scales and arithmetical sailing by
divers of the young men of the sea-coast towns, even as
commonly amongst them, as amongst the Thamesers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some of these
be 60 and 80
tons, the
burden.</div>

<p>Besides all the Hollanders before spoken of, the Frenchmen
of Picardy have also a hundred sail of fishermen,
only [<i>solely</i>] for herrings on His Majesty's seas every
year in the summer season; and they be almost like
unto the Busses: but they have not any Yagers that cometh
unto them, but they do lade themselves, and return home twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
every year; and find great profit by their making but two
voyages every summer season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hollanders
do yearly take
so many, as
they do make
more than two
millions of
pounds sterling.
And we,
his Majesty's
subjects, do
take no more
than do bait
our hooks!</div>

<p>And it is much to be lamented that we, having such a
plentiful country, and such store of able and idle
people, that not one of His Majesty's subjects is
there to be seen all the whole summer to fish or
to take one herring; but only the North Sea boats
of the sea-coast towns that go to take Cod, they
do take so many as they do need to bait their
hooks and no more.</p>

<p>We are daily scorned by these Hollanders for
being so negligent of our profit, and careless of our fishing;
and they do daily flout us that be the poor fishermen of
England, to our faces at sea, calling to us and saying, <i>Ya</i>
<i>English! ya zall, or oud scove dragien</i>, which in English is
this, "You English! we will make you glad for to wear our
old shoes."</p>

<p>And likewise the Frenchmen, they say, "We are apish," for
that we do still imitate them in all needless and fantastical
jags [<i>tatters</i>] and fashions. As it is most true indeed. For
that they have no fashion amongst them in apparel nor lace,
points, gloves, hilts, nor garters; even from the spangled
shoe-latchet unto the spangled hat and hatband (be it never
so idle and costly): but after that we do once get it, it is far
bettered by our nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sailor's
proverb, The
sea and the
gallows refuse
none!</div>

<p>Wherefore, seeing that we can excel all other nations,
wastefully to spend money; let us in one thing learn of
other nations! to get thousands out of His Majesty's sea!
and to make a general profit of the benefits that Almighty
GOD doth yearly send unto us, in far more greater abundance
than the fruit of our trees! which although they [<i>the fishes</i>]
be more changeable in the gathering together, yet is the
profit far more greater unto this kingdom and common wealth
of all His Majesty's subjects, increasing the wealth of the
Adventurers; as also for the enriching of Merchants, and
maintaining of trades, occupations, and employing of ships,
and increasing of mariners which now do but little or
nothing; as also for the setting of poor and idle people on
work, which now know not how to live. And to teach many
a tall fellow to know the proper names of the ropes in a
ship, and to haul the bowline; that now for lack of em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>ployment
many such, by the inconvenience of idle living,
are compelled to end their days with a rope by an
untimely death; which by the employment of the
Busses might be well avoided, and they in time
become right honest, serviceable, and trusty subjects.</p>

<p>[It is singular that this truly astonishing Poem, a poetical <i>tour de force</i>
as it is, should not hitherto have obtained a universal acceptance and
recognition. In it we see <span class="smcap">Wither</span> at his prime; and cannot but admire
as much the sterling integrity of his Character, as the wonderful fertility
of his poetical Invention.</p>

<p>His mastery herein over rhythm and rhyme, also amply vindicates the
opinion of Dryden: who, considering himself unmatched by any in facility
of versification, openly excepted <span class="smcap">Wither</span>, and <span class="smcap">F. Quarles</span>.</p>

<h3>THE STATIONER<br />
TO THE READER.
</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/355t.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> being one of the Author's first poems, was
composed many years agone; and (unknown to
him) gotten out of his custody by an acquaintance
of his. And coming lately to my hands, without
a name: it was thought to have so much resemblance
of the Maker, that many, upon the first sight, undertook
to guess who was the author of it; and [were] persuaded
that it was likely also, to become profitable both to them
and me.</p>

<p>Whereupon, I got it authorised, according to Order [<i>It</i>
<i>was entered at Stationers' Hall, on 31st January, 1622</i>]; intending
to publish it without further inquiry.</p>

<p>But attaining by chance, a more perfect knowledge, to
whom it most properly belonged; I thought it fitting to acquaint
him therewithal. And did so, desiring also both his
good will to publish the same, and leave to pass it under
his name. Both [of] which, I found him very unwilling to
permit; least the seeming lightness of such a subject might
somewhat disparage the more serious studies, which he hath
since undertaken.</p>

<p>Yet doubting (this being got out of his custody) some more
imperfect copies might be scattered abroad, in writing; or be
(unknown to him) imprinted: he was pleased, upon my importunities,
to condescend [<i>agree</i>] that it might be published
without his name.</p>

<p>And his words were these:</p>

<p>"When," said he, "I first composed it, I well liked there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>of;
and it well enough became my years; but, now, I neither
like nor dislike it. That, therefore, it should be divulged, I
desire not! and whether it be; or whether, if it so happen,
it be approved or not, I care not! For this I am sure of,
howsoever it is valued, it is worth as much as I prize it at.
Likely it is also, to be as beneficial to the world, as the
world hath been to me; and will be more than those who like
it not, ever deserved at my hands."</p>

<p>These were his speeches. And if you looked for a Prologue,
thus much he wished me to tell you, instead thereof,
"because," as he said, "he himself had somewhat else to do."</p>

<p>Yet, to acknowledge the truth, I was so earnest with him,
that, busy as he would seem to be, I got him to write this
<i>Epistle</i> for me. And have thereunto set <i>my</i> name: which he
wished me to confess, partly, to avoid the occasion of belying
my invention; and partly, because he thought some of you
would suppose so much.</p>

<p>I entreated him to explain his meaning in certain obscure
passages. But he told me how "that were to take away the
employment of his interpreters [<i>critics</i>]: whereas he would,
purposely, leave something remaining doubtful, to see what
Sir <span class="smcap">Politic Would-be</span> and his companions would pick out
of it."</p>

<p>I desired him also to set down, to what good purposes, this
Poem would serve. But his reply was how "that would be
well enough found out in the perusing, by all such as had
honest understandings; and they who are not so provided, he
hopes will not read it."</p>

<p>More, I could not get from him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether, therefore, the <i>Mistress of <span class="smcap">Phil'arete</span></i> be really a
Woman, shadowed under the name of <i><span class="smcap">Virtue</span></i>; or Virtue only,
whose loveliness is represented by the beauty of an excellent
Woman: or whether it mean both together, I cannot tell
you!</p>

<p>But thus much dare I promise for your money, that, here,
you shall find, familiarly expressed, both such beauties as
young men are most entangled withal; and the excellency
also of such as are most worthy their affection. That seeing
both impartially set forth by him, that was capable of both;
they might the better settle their love on the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Hereby, also, those women, who desire to be truly beloved,
may know what makes them so to be: and seek to acquire
those accomplishments of the Mind which may endear them,
when the sweetest features of a beautiful Face shall be converted
into deformities.</p>

<p>And here is described that Loveliness of theirs, which is the
principal object of wanton affection, to no worse end, but that
those (who would never have looked on this Poem, if Virtue and
Goodness had been therein no otherwise represented, than as
they are Objects of the Soul) might (where they expected the
satisfaction of their sensuality only) meet with that also,
which would insinuate into them an Apprehension of more
reasonable, and most excellent perfections. Yea, whereas the
common opinion of Youth hath been, that only old men, and
such as are unable, or past delighting in a bodily loveliness,
are those who are best capable of the Mind's perfections; and
that they do, therefore, so much prefer them before the other,
because their age or stupidity hath deprived them of being
sensible what pleasures they yield: though this be the
vulgar error; yet, here, it shall appear, that he who is able
to conceive the most excellent Pleasingness which could be
apprehended in a corpor[e]al Beauty, found it (even when he
was most enamoured with it) far short of that inexpressible
Sweetness, which he discovered in a virtuous and well
tempered Disposition.</p>

<p>And if this be not worth your money; keep it!</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Nor rumour of the Muses, till of late)</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>A Shepherd's Lad was He, obscure and young,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who, being first that ever there had sung,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In homely verse, express&egrave;d country loves,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Beyond the compass that his sheepwalk went.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>They saw him not, nor them perceiv&egrave;d he;</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>He shrouded sate: and taught the hollow hill</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a><br /><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a><br /><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a><br /><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To echo forth the music of his quill;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whose tattling voice redoubled so the sound,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That where he was concealed, they quickly found.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And there, they heard him sing a Madrigal</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That soon betrayed his cunning to them all.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Full rude it was, no doubt, but such a Song,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Those rustic and obscur&egrave;d shades among,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was never heard, they say, by any ear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Until his Muses had inspired him there.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Though mean and plain, his country habit seemed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet by his Song, the Ladies rightly deemed</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That either he had travell&egrave;d abroad,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where Swains of better knowledge make abode;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or else, that some brave Nymph who used that grove,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Had deign&egrave;d to enrich him with her love.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Approaching nearer, therefore, to this Swain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Them, him saluted; and he, them again,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In such good fashion, as well seemed to be</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>According to their state, and his degree.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which greetings being passed, and much chat</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Concerning him, the place, with this and that;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He, to an arbour doth those Beauties bring,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where he, them prays to sit; they, him to sing,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And to express that untaught Country Art,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In setting forth the Mistress of his heart;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which they o'erheard him practice, when unseen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He thought no ear had witness of it been.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>At first, as much unable, he refused,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And seem&egrave;d willing to have been excused</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From such a task, "For trust me, Nymphs!" quoth he,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"I would not purposely uncivil be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor churlish in denying what you crave!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But, as I hope great <span class="smcap">Pan</span> my flock will save!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I rather wish that I might, heard of none,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Enjoy my music by myself alone;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or that the murmurs of some little flood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Joined with the friendly echoes of the wood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Might be the impartial umpires of my wit;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than vent it where the world might hear of it.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And doubtless, I had sung less loud while-ere,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Had I but thought of any such so near.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not that I either wish obscurified</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her matchless Beauty, or desire to hide</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her sweet Perfections. For, by <span class="smcap">Love</span> I swear!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The utmost happiness I aim at here</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is but to compass Worth enough to raise</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A high built Trophy equal to her praise.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Which, fairest Ladies! I shall hope in vain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For I was meanly bred on yonder plain!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And though I can well prove my blood to be</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Derived from no ignoble Stems, to me:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet Fate and Time them so obscured and crosst</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with their fortunes, their esteem is lost;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And whatsoe'er repute I strive to win,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now from myself alone, it must begin.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For I have no estate, nor friends, nor fame,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To purchase either credit to my name,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or gain a good opinion; though I do</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ascend the height I shall aspire unto.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>If any of those virtues yet I have</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which honour to my predecessors gave;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There's all, that's left me! And though some contemn</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Such needy jewels: yet it was for them,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My Fair One did my humble suit affect;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And deign&egrave;d my adventurous love, respect:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And by their help, I passage hope to make,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Through such poor things as I dare undertake.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>But, you may say, 'What goodly thing, alas,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Can my despis&egrave;d meanness bring to pass?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or what great Monument of Honour raise</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To <span class="smcap">Virtue</span>, in these vice abounding days?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In which, a thousand times, more honour finds,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ignoble gotten Means, than noble Minds.'</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Indeed, the world affordeth small reward</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For honest minds, and therefore her regard</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I seek not after; neither do I care,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If I have bliss, how others think I fare!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For, so my thoughts have rest; it irks not me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Though none, but I, do know how blest they be.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Here, therefore, in these groves and hidden plains,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I pleas&egrave;d, sit alone, and many strains</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I carol to myself, these hills among,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where no man comes to interrupt my song.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whereas, if my rude Lays, make known I should,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beyond their home; perhaps, some carpers would</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>(Because they have not heard from whence we be)</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traduce, abuse, and scoff both them and me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For if our great and learned Shepherds (who</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Are graced with Wit, and Fame, and Favours too)</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With much ado, escape uncensured may;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What hopes have I to pass unscorched, I pray!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who yet unto the Muses am unknown,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And live unhonoured, here, among mine own?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>A gadding humour seldom taketh me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To range out further than yon mountains be;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor hath applausive Rumour borne my name</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Upon the spreading wings of sounding Fame:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor can I think, fair Nymphs! that you resort</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For other purpose, than to make a sport</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>At that simplicity, which shall appear</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Among the rude untutored Shepherds here.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>I know, that you, my noble Mistress ween,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>At best, a homely milkmaid on the green,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or some such country lass as task&egrave;d stays</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>At servile labour until holidays.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For poor men's virtues so neglected grow,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And are now priz&egrave;d at a rate so low;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As, 'tis impossible, you should be brought</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To let it with belief possess your thought,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That any Nymph, whose love might worthy be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Would deign to cast respective eyes on me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You see I live, possessing none of those</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gay things, with which the world enamoured grows.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To woo a Courtly Beauty, I have neither</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rings, bracelets, jewels; nor a scarf, nor feather.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I use no double-dy&egrave;d cloth to wear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No scrip embroidered richly, do I bear:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No silken belt, nor sheephook laid with pearls,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To win me favour from the shepherds' girls.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No Place of Office or Command I keep,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But this my little flock of homely sheep.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, in a word; the sum of all my pelf</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is this</i>, I am the Master of myself!<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>No doubt, in Courts of Princes you have been!</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And all the pleasures of the Palace seen!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There, you beheld brave Courtly passages</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Between Heroes and their Mistresses.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You, there, perhaps, in presence of the King,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Have heard his learned Bards and Poets sing!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And what contentment, then, can wood or field,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To please your curious understandings yield?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I know you walk&egrave;d hither, but to prove</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What silly Shepherds do conceive of love?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or to make trial how our simpleness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Can Passions' force, or Beauty's power express?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And when you are departed, you will joy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To laugh, or descant on the Shepherd's Boy!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>But yet, I vow! if all the Art I had</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Could any more esteem or glory add</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To her unmatch&egrave;d worth; I would not weigh</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What you intended," "Prithee, Lad!" quoth they,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"Distrustful of our courtesy do not seem!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her nobleness can never want esteem,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor thy conceal&egrave;d Measures be disgraced;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Though in a meaner person they were placed.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If thy too modestly reserv&egrave;d quill</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But reach that height, which we suppose it will;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thy meanness or obscureness cannot wrong</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Nymph thou shalt eternize in thy Song.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For, as it higher rears thy glory, that</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A noble Mistress thou hast aim&egrave;d at;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So, more unto her honour it will prove</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That (whilst deceiving shadows others move)</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her constant eyes could pass unmov&egrave;d by</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The subtle Time's bewitching bravery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And those obscur&egrave;d virtues love in thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with despis&egrave;d meanness clouded be.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Now then, for Her sweet sake! whose beauteous eye</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hath filled thy Soul with heavenly Poesy;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sing in her praise some new inspir&egrave;d Strain!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if, within our power, there shall remain</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A favour to be done to pleasure thee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ask and obtain it, whatsoe'er it be!"</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>"Fair Ladies!" quoth the Lad, "such words as those,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Compel me can": and therewithal he rose,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Returned them thanks, obeisance made; and then</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Down sate again, and thus to sing began.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Keeping such a decent state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, indeed, she seems to hate<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, well they know not, whether did belong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most praise unto the Shepherd, or his Song.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet, when they well considered of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With how unlikely (in their thought) it was<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or that so young, and so obscure a Swain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should such a matchless Beauty's favour get;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know her worth so well, to sing of it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wondered at it. And some thus surmised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That He a greater man was, so disguised;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Of purpose, to that rare attain&egrave;d height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Envy's, and presuming Art's despite.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But whilst they, musing with themselves, bethought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, though obscure, by some, he is esteemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Greatest: who do not contemn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his retir&egrave;d walks, to visit him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, they taste those pleasures of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which they can, nor in Court, nor City find.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some news or message, these new guests had brought him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to make haste away, it seems, besought him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For instantly he rose! And that his nurture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might not be taxed by a rude departure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself excusing; he, those Nymphs did pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His noble friends might bring him on their way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who, as it seems," said he, "were therefore come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they might wait upon him to their home."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, with their favour, he departed thence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as they thought, to meet her Excellence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom he sung. Yet many deem that this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an <i>Idea</i> of a Mistress is:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because to none, he yet had deigned the telling<br /></span>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> upon Our return, the last year out
of Scotland, We did publish Our Pleasure
touching the recreations of Our people in
those parts, under Our hand: for some
causes Us thereunto moving, We have
thought good to command these Our
Directions, then given in Lancashire, with
a few words thereunto added and most
appliable to these parts of Our Realms, to be published to all
Our subjects.</p>

<p>Whereas We did justly, in Our progress through Lancashire,
rebuke some Puritans and precise people, and took
order that the like unlawful carriage should not be used by
any of them hereafter, in the prohibiting and unlawful punishing
of Our good people for using their lawful recreations and
honest exercises upon Sundays and other Holy Days, after
the afternoon Sermon or Service; We now find, that two
sorts of people wherewith that country [<i>county</i>] is much infested
(We mean Papists and Puritans) have maliciously
traduced and caluminated those Our just and honourable proceedings.
And therefore lest Our reputation might, upon the
one side, though innocently, have some aspersion laid upon
it; and that, upon the other part, Our good people in that
country be misled by the mistaking and misinterpretation of
Our meaning: We have therefore thought good hereby to
clear and make Our Pleasure to be manifested to all Our
good people in those parts.</p>

<p>It is true, that at Our first entry to this Crown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
Kingdom, We were informed, and that too truly, that Our
County of Lancashire abounded more in Popish Recusants
than any county in England; and thus hath still continued
since, to our great regret, with little amendment,
save that now, of late, in our last riding through Our said
County, We find, both by the report of the Judges, and
of the Bishops of that diocese, that there is some amendment
now daily beginning, which is no small contentment to
Us.</p>

<p>The report of this growing amendment amongst them,
made Us the more sorry, when, with Our own ears, We heard
the general complaint of Our people, that they were barred
from all lawful recreation and exercise upon the Sunday's
afternoon, after the ending of all Divine Service. Which cannot
but produce two evils. The one, the hindering of the
conversion of many whom their priests will take occasion
hereby to vex; persuading them that "no honest mirth or
recreation is lawful or tolerable in Our Religion!" which
cannot but breed a great discontentment in Our people's
hearts; especially of such as are, peradventure, upon the
point of turning. The other inconvenience is, that this prohibition
barreth the common and meaner sort of people from
using such exercises as may make their bodies more able for
war, when We, or Our Successors shall have occasion to use
them: and in place thereof sets up filthy tiplings and
drunkenness, and breeds a number of idle and discontented
speeches in their alehouses. For when shall the common
people have leave to exercise, if not upon the Sundays and
Holy Days? seeing they must apply their labour, and win
their living in all working days!</p>

<p>Our express pleasure therefore is, <i>That the Laws of Our</i>
<i>Kingdom, and Canons of Our Church be as well observed in that</i>
<i>County, as in all other places of this Our Kingdom. And, on the</i>
<i>other part, that no lawful recreation shall be barred to our good</i>
<i>people, which shall not tend to the breach of Our aforesaid Laws,</i>
<i>and Canons of Our Church.</i></p>

<p>Which to express more particularly,</p>

<p>Our Pleasure is, <i>That the Bishop and all other inferior</i>
<i>Churchmen</i> [Clergy], <i>and Churchwardens shall, for their parts, be</i>
<i>careful and diligent, both to instruct the ignorant, and convince</i>
<i>and reform them that are misled in religion, presenting</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>porting
for punishment] <i>them that will not conform themselves,</i>
<i>but obstinately stand out to Our Judges and Justices: whom,</i>
<i>We likewise command to put the law in due execution against</i>
<i>them</i>.</p>

<p>Our Pleasure likewise is, <i>That the Bishop of that diocese take</i>
<i>the like strait order with all the Puritans and Precisians within</i>
<i>the same: either constraining them to conform themselves, or to</i>
<i>leave the country, according to the Laws of Our Kingdom and</i>
<i>Canons of Our Church</i>. And so to strike equally on both hands
against the Contemners of Our Authority, and Adversaries of
Our Church.</p>

<p>And as for Our good people's lawful recreation; Our
Pleasure likewise is, <i>That after the end of Divine Service, Our</i>
<i>good people be not disturbed, letted, or discouraged from any lawful</i>
<i>recreation, such as Dancing (either men or women), Archery for</i>
<i>men, Leaping, Vaulting, or any other such harmless recreations;</i>
<i>nor from having of May Games, Whitsun Ales, and Morris Dances;</i>
<i>and the setting up of May Poles, and other sports therewith used:</i>
<i>so as the same be had in due and convenient time, without impediment</i>
<i>or neglect of Divine Service</i>. And, <i>That women shall have</i>
<i>leave to carry rushes to the church for the decoring</i> [decorating] <i>of</i>
<i>it, according to their old custom</i>.</p>

<p>But withal, <i>We do here account still as prohibited, all unlawful</i>
<i>games, to be used upon Sundays only; as Bear and Bull baitings,</i>
<i>Interludes: and, at all times, in the meaner sort of people by Law</i>
<i>prohibited, Bowling</i>.</p>

<p>And, likewise, <i>We bar from this benefit and liberty, all such</i>
<i>known Recusants, either men or women, as will abstain from</i>
<i>coming to Church or Divine Service</i>: being, therefore, unworthy
of any lawful recreation after the said Service, that will not
first come to the Church, and serve GOD.</p>

<p><i>Prohibiting, in like sort, the said recreation to any that, though</i>
<i>conforme</i> [conformable] <i>in Religion, are not present in the Church,</i>
<i>at the Service of GOD, before their going to the said recreations</i>.</p>

<p>Our Pleasure likewise is, <i>That they to whom it belongeth in</i>
<i>Office, shall present, and sharply punish all such, as in abuse of</i>
<i>this Our liberty, will use these exercises before the ends of all Divine</i>
<i>Services for that day</i>.</p>

<p>And We, likewise, straitly command, <i>That every person shall</i>
<i>resort to his own Parish Church to hear Divine Service; and each</i>
<i>Parish, by itself, to use the said recreation after Divine Service</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
Prohibiting likewise, <i>Any offensive weapons to be carried or used</i>
<i>in the said times of recreation</i>.</p>

<p>And Our Pleasure is, <i>That this Our Declaration shall be published</i>
<i>by order from the Bishop of the diocese, through all the Parish</i>
<i>Churches; and that both Our Judges of Our Circuit, and</i>
<i>Our Justices of Our Peace be informed thereof</i>.</p>

<p>Given at Our Manor of Greenwich, the four and twentieth
day of May [1618] in the sixteenth year of Our reign of
England, France, and Ireland; and of Scotland, the one and
fiftieth.</p>

<p><i>Your Ladyship hath in yourself, an excellent agreement of many</i>

<p>I assure you that both my charge and pains in publishing
it, hath exceeded ordinary [ones]: yet thus much I have to
assure me of requital, that neither the work is ordinary; nor
are your judgements ordinary, to whom I present it! so that
I have no reason but to hope for good increase in my labours,
especially of your good favours towards me; which of all
things I most esteem. Which if I find in this, I mean shortly,
GOD willing, to set at liberty for your service, a prisoner taken
at Cadiz: who, if he discovers not something, in [the] matter
of music, worthy [of] your knowledge; let the reputation of
my judgement in music answer [for] it!</p>

<p>[It will be necessary, ere long, to establish a <i>Society for the Preservation</i>
<i>of the Memory of the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> Kings of England, from Universal Execration</i>;
so much is it now seen, that, stripped of the mantle of their
Kingship, they were unworthy of the name of English Gentlemen. Scotland
could have sent us many a better bred family!</p>

<p>What a picture has the good Archbishop given us of the English King
and Court in the first days of the reign of the so called Royal Martyr.
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>, first claiming for himself an unbounded power over his subjects,
and then lavishly bestowing it on his favourite <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>, is the
modern counterpart of <span class="smcap">Nebuchadnezzar</span> setting up his golden image
"in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."</p>

<p>Note that this Narrative was written without the faintest conception
or realisation of such a possibility as a national rising under the
guidance of the Long Parliament. The two characters, of <span class="smcap">Laud</span> at <i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_548">548</a>,
and of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> at <i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_574">574</a>, are Eye-Witness portraits, and should be
included, unabridged, in every future History of England. Imagine an
Archbishop scornfully speaking (<i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_548">548</a>) of Bishop <span class="smcap">Laud</span> as "what a
sweet man he was likely to be!"</p>

<p>It should be also remembered that <span class="smcap">Laud</span> records in his <i>Diary</i>, that
on the 2nd October, 1626 (<i>i.e.</i>, nine months before the Archbishop's
present Narrative was written), <span class="smcap">Charles I.</span> promised him the reversion
of the Archbishopric, when Doctor <span class="smcap">Abbot</span> should die.]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is an example, so without example, that in the
sunshine of the Gospel; in the midst of profession
of the true religion; under a gracious King, whom
all the world must acknowledge to be blemished
with no vice; a man of my place and years, who
has done some service in the Church and Commonwealth, so
deeply laden with some furious infirmities of body, should be
removed from his ordinary habitation, and, by a kind of
deportation, should be thrust into one end of the Island
(although I must confess into his own diocese), that I hold
it fit that the reason of it should be truly understood, lest it
may someways turn to the scandal of my person and calling.
Which Declaration, notwithstanding, I intend not to communicate
to any, but to let it lie by me privately; that it
being set down impartially, whilst all things are fresh in
memory, I may have recourse to it hereafter, if questions
shall be made of anything contained in this Relation.</p>

<p>And this I hold necessary to be done, by reason of the
strangeness of that, which, by way of Censure, was inflicted
upon me; being then of the age of sixty-five years, encumbered
with the gout, and afflicted with the stone: having
lived so many years in a Place of great service, and, for
ought I know, untainted in any of my actions; although my
Master, King <span class="smcap">James</span> (who resteth with GOD) had both a
searching wit of his own to discover his servants, whom he
put in trust, whether they took any sinister courses or not;
and wanted not some suggesters about him, to make the
worst of all men's actions whom they could misreport.</p>

<p>Yet this innocency and good fame to be overthrown in a
month! and a Christian Bishop suddenly to be made <i>fabula</i>
<i>vulgi</i>, to be tossed upon the tongues of friends and foes, of
Protestants and Papists, of Court and Country, of English
and Foreigners, must needs, in common opinion, presuppose
some crime, open or secret; which, being discovered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
King, albeit not fully appearing to the world, must draw on
indignation in so high a measure.</p>

<p>I cannot deny that the indisposition of my body kept me
from Court, and thereby gave occasion to maligners to traduce
me, as, "withdrawing myself from public services, and therefore
misliking some courses that were taken": which abstaining,
perhaps, neither pleased the King, nor the Great Man
that set them on foot.</p>

<p>It is true, that in the turbulency of some things, I had not
great invitements to draw me abroad; but to possess my soul
in patience till GOD sent fairer weather. But the true ground
for my abstaining from solemn and public places, was the
weakness of my feet, proceeding from the gout: which
disease being hereditary unto me, and having possessed me
now nine years, had debilitated me more and more; so that
I could not stand at all, neither could I go up or down a pair
of stairs but, besides my staff, I must have the service of
one at least, of my men, who were not fit to be admitted in
every place where I was to come.</p>

<p>And although I was oft remembered by the wisest of my
friends, that "I might be carried, as the old Lord Treasurer
<span class="smcap">Burleigh</span> was!" yet I did not think my service so necessary
for the commonwealth, as his Lordship's, by long experience,
was found to be. I did not value myself at so high a
rate; but remembered that it was not the least cause of
overthrow to <span class="smcap">Robert [Devereux]</span>, Earl of <span class="smcap">Essex</span>, that he
prized himself so, as if Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> and the Kingdom
could not well have stood, if he had not supported both the
one and the other.</p>

<p>Now for me, thus enfeebled, not with gout only, but with
the stone and gravel, to wait on the King or the Council
Table, was, by me, held a matter most inconvenient. In the
Courts of Princes, there is little feeling of [<i>for</i>] the infirmities
belonging to old age. They like them that be young and
gallant in their actions, and in their clothes. They love not
that men should stick too long in any room of greatness.
Change and alteration bringeth somewhat with it; what have
they to do with kerchiefs and staves, with lame or sickly
men? It is certainly true, there is little compassion upon the
bodily defects of any. The Scripture speaketh of "men standing
before Kings." It were an uncouth sight to see the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
sit the day before the Coronation: when, on the morrow, I
had work enough for the strongest man in England, being
weak in my feet, and coming to Whitehall to see things in
readiness against the next day. Yet, notwithstanding the
stone and gout, I was not altogether an inutile servant in the
King's affairs; but did all things in my house that were to
be done: as in keeping the High Commission Court, doing
all inferior actions conducing thereto; and despatching references
from His Majesty that came thick upon me.</p>

<p>These Relations which are made concerning me, be of
certain truth; but reach not to the reason I was discarded.</p>

<p>To understand therefore the verity, so it is, that the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> (being still great in the favour of the King;
could endure no man that would not depend upon him) among
other men, had me in his eye, for not stooping unto him, so
as to become his vassal.</p>

<p>I (that had learned a lesson, which I constantly hold, <i>To</i>
<i>be no man's servant, but the King's</i>: for mine old royal Master
which is with GOD, and mine own reason did teach me so)
went on mine own ways; although I could not but observe,
that as many as walked in that path did suffer for it upon all
occasions, and so did I: nothing wherein I moved my Master
taking place; which, finding so clearly (as if the Duke had
set some ill character upon me), I had no way but to rest in
patience; leaving all to GOD, and looking to myself as
warily as I might. But this did not serve the turn; his
undertakings were so extraordinary, that every one that was
not with him, was presently [<i>instantly</i>] against him: and if a
hard opinion were once entertained, there was no place left
for satisfaction or reconciliation. What befell the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Randal Carew</span>, and divers others, I need not
to report; and no man can make doubt but he blew the
coals.</p>

<p>For myself, there is a gentleman called Sir H. S., who
gave the first light what should befall me.</p>

<p>This Knight, being of more livelihood than wisdom, had
married the Lady D., sister of the now Earl of E.; and
had so treated her, both for safeguard of her honour, blemished
by him scandalously; and for her alimony or maintenance,
being glad to get from him; she was forced to endure a suit
in the High Commission Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>So to strengthen his party, he was made known to the
Duke; and, by means of a dependent on his Grace, he got a
letter from the King, that "The Commissioners should proceed
no further in hearing of that cause; by reason that it being
a difference between a Gentleman and his Wife, the King's
Majesty would hear it himself." The solicitor for the lady,
finding that the course of Justice was stopped, did so earnestly,
by petition, move the King, that, by another letter, there was
a relaxation of the former restraint, and the Commissioners
Ecclesiastical went on.</p>

<p>But now, in the new proceeding, finding himself by justice
like[ly] enough to be pinched; he did publicly in the Court,
refuse to speak by any Counsel, but would plead his cause
himself: wherein he did bear the whole business so disorderly
and tumultuously, and unrespectively [<i>disrespectfully</i>], that,
after divers reproofs, I was enforced, for the honour of the
Court and the reputation of the High Commission, to tell
him openly that "If he did not carry himself in a better
fashion, I would commit him to prison!"</p>

<p>This so troubled the young gallant, that, within few days
after, being at dinner or supper (where some wished me well),
he bolted it out that "As for the Archbishop, the Duke had a
purpose to turn him out of his Place, and that he did but wait
the occasion to effect it." Which being brought unto me,
constantly, by more ways than one; I was now in expectation,
what must be the issue of this Great Man's indignation;
which fell out to be, as followeth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was one <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>, who, not being so much as a
Bachelor of Arts (as it hath been credibly reported unto me),
by means of Doctor <span class="smcap">Peirce</span>, Dean of Peterborough (being
Vice Chancellor of Oxford), did get to be confirmed upon him,
the title of a Doctor.</p>

<p>This man is Vicar of Brackley, in Northamptonshire; and
hath another benefice not far from it, in Buckinghamshire:
but the lustre of his honour did arise from being the son-in-law
of Sir <span class="smcap">John Lamb</span>, Chancellor of Peterborough, whose
daughter he married; and was put into the Commission of
Peace.</p>

<p>When the Lent Assizes were, in February last [1627], at
Northampton, the man that preached [<i>on the 22nd of the month</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
before the Judges there, was this worthy Doctor: where,
magnifying the authority of Kings (which is so strong in the
Scripture, that it needs no flattery any ways to extol it), he
let fall divers speeches which were distasteful to the auditors,
and namely, "That Kings had power to put poll money upon
their subjects' heads": when, against those challenges, men
did frequently mourn.</p>

<p>He, being a man of low fortune, conceived that the putting
his sermon [<i>entitled "Apostolical Obedience"</i>] in print, might
gain favour at Court and raise his fortune higher, on he goeth
with the transcribing of his sermon; and got a bishop or two
to prefer this great service to the Duke. It being brought
unto the Duke, it cometh in his head, or was suggested to
him by some malicious body, that, thereby, the Archbishop
might be put to some remarkable strait. For if the King
should send the sermon unto him, and command him to allow
it to the press, one of these two things would follow: that,
either he should authorise it, and so, all men that were indifferent
should discover him for a base and unworthy beast;
or he should refuse it, and so should fall into the King's
indignation, who might pursue it at his pleasure as against
a man that was contrary to his service.</p>

<p>Out of this fountain flowed all the water that afterwards so
wet. In rehearsing whereof, I must set down divers particulars;
which some man may wonder how they should be
discovered unto me: but let it suffice, once for all, that in the
word of an honest man and a Bishop, I recount nothing but
whereof I have good warrant; GOD Himself working means.</p>

<p>The matters were revealed unto me, although it be not
convenient that, in this Paper, I name the manner how they
came unto me; lest such as did, by well doing, farther me,
should receive blame for their labour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, resolved it is, that "I be put to it! and that, with
speed!" and therefore Master <span class="smcap">William Murray</span> (nephew as,
I think, unto Master <span class="smcap">Thomas Murray</span>, sometimes Tutor to
Prince <span class="smcap">Charles</span>), now of the King's Bedchamber, is sent to
me with the written Sermon: of whom, I must say, that
albeit he did the King his Master's service; yet he did use
himself temperately and civilly unto me.</p>

<p>For avoiding of <i>inquit</i> and <i>inquam</i>, as <span class="smcap">Tully</span> saith, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span><i>I said</i>
<i>this</i> and <i>he said that</i>, I will make it by way of dialogue: not
setting down every day's conference exactly by itself, but
mentioning all things in the whole; yet distinguishing of times
where, for the truth of the Relation, it cannot be avoided.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> My Lord! I am sent unto you by the King, to
let you know that his pleasure is, That whereas there is
brought unto him, a Sermon to be printed: you should allow
this Sermon to the press.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I was never he that authorised books to be
printed: for it is the work of my Chaplains to read over other
men's writings, and what is fit, to let it go; what is unfit, to
expunge it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> But the King will have you yourself to do this,
because he is minded that no books shall be allowed, but by
you and the Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span> [<i>then <span class="smcap">George Montaigne</span></i>]:
and my Lord of <span class="smcap">London</span> authorised one the other day,
<span class="smcap">Cosens</span>'s book; and he will have you do this.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> This is an occupation that my old Master, King
<span class="smcap">James</span>, did never put me to; and yet I was then young, and
had more abilities of body than I now have: so that I see I
must now learn a new lesson. But leave it with me! and
when I have read it, I shall know what to say unto it. A
day or two hence, you shall understand my mind.</p></div>

<p>When I had once or twice perused it; I found some words
which seemed to me to cross that which the King intended,
and, in a sort, to destroy it; and therefore upon his return a
day or two after, I expressed myself thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span>! I conceive that the King intended that
this Sermon shall promote the service now in hand about
the Loan of Money: but in my opinion he much crosseth
it. For he layeth it down for a rule (and because it should
not be forgotten, he repeateth it again) that <i>Christians</i>
<i>are bound in duty one to another, especially all subjects to</i>
<i>their Princes, according to the Laws and Customs of the</i>
<i>Kingdom wherein they live</i>. Out of this, will men except
this Loan; because there is neither Law nor Custom for
it, in the Kingdom of England.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Secondly. In my judgement, there followeth a dangerous
speech, <i>Habemus necessitatem vindicanda libertatis</i>. (For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
this was all that was then quoted out of <span class="smcap">Calvin</span>, no
mention being made of any of the other words which are,
now, in the printed copy.) For when, by the former rule
he hath set men at liberty whether they will pay or not; he
imposeth upon them a necessity to vindicate this liberty;
and <i>vindicare</i> may be extended to challenge with violence,
<i>cum vi</i>. But, for my part, I would be most unwilling to
give occasion to Sedition and Mutiny in the kingdom!</p>

<p>Again, here is mention made of Poll Money; which,
as I have heard, hath already caused much distaste
where the Sermon was preached.</p>

<p>Moreover, what a speech is this? <i>That he observes the</i>
<i>forwardness of the Papists to offer double according to an Act</i>
<i>of Parliament so providing; yea, to profess that they would</i>
<i>part with the half of their goods</i>: where he quoteth in the
margent, <i>Anno I. <span class="smcap">Caroli</span>, the Act for the Subsidy of the</i>
<i>Laity, whereby Popish Recusants were to pay double</i>; when
indeed there is <i>no such Act</i>!</p>

<p>And in the fifth place, it is said in this Sermon, that
<i>the Princes of Bohemia have power to depose their Kings, as</i>
<i>not being hereditary</i>. Which is a great question: such a
one as hath cost much blood; and must not in a word
be absolutely defined here, as if it were without controversy.</p>

<p>I pray you, make His Majesty acquainted with these
things! and take the book with you!</p></div>

<p>Where it is to be noted, that, all this time, we had but one
single copy [<i>manuscript</i>]; which was sometimes at the Court,
and sometimes left with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> I will faithfully deliver these things to the King,
and then you shall hear further from me!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some two or three days after, he returneth again unto me,
and telleth me, That he had particularly acquainted the King
with my objections; and His Majesty made this answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First. For the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom,
he did not stand upon that. He had a precedent for
that which he did, and thereon he would insist.</p></div>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I think that to be a mistaking; for I fear there
will be found no such precedent. King <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>, as the
Chronicle sheweth, desired but a Sixth Part of men's estates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
Ten Groats in the Pound: our King desireth the whole six
parts, full out; so much as men are set at in the <i>Subsidy Book</i>.
And in the time of King <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, although he were a powerful
King; yet, for that taxation, there began against him little
less than a rebellion; so that he held it wisdom to desist;
and, laying the blame upon Cardinal <span class="smcap">Wolsey</span>, professed that
"he knew nothing of the matter."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> Secondly. The King saith for the words,
<i>Habemus necessitatem vindicanda libertatis</i>; he taketh them
to be for him, and he will stand upon his liberty.</p>

<p>Thirdly. For Poll Money, he thinketh it lawful.</p>

<p>Fourthly. It is true, there was no such Act passed;
and therefore it must be amended. (And yet in the
printed book, it is suffered still to stand! Such slight,
and, I may say, slovenly care was had, by them that
published this Sermon.)</p>

<p>And fifthly. For that of Bohemia: he hath crossed it
out of the book.</p></div>

<p>Some other matters there were, against which I took
exception; but Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span> being a young gentleman,
although witty and full of good behaviour: I doubted that,
being not deeply seen in Divinity, he could not so well conceive
me or make report of my words to His Majesty: and
therefore I, being lame and so disabled to wait on the King,
did move him, that "He would, in my name, humbly beseech
His Majesty to send [<i><span class="smcap">William Laud</span>, then</i>] the Bishop of
<span class="smcap">Bath and Wells</span> unto me; and I would, by his means, make
known my scruples." And so I dismissed Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span>;
observing with myself, that the Answers to my five Objections
especially to two or three [of them], were somewhat strange;
as if the King were resolved (were it to his good, or to his
harm) to have the book go forth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After one or two days more, the young Gentleman cometh
to me again, and telleth me, that "The King did not think it
fit to send the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Bath</span> unto me; but that expecteth
I should pass the book."</p>

<p>In the meantime, had gone over one High Commission
day; and this Bishop (who used otherwise on very few days,
to fail) was not there: which being joined to His Majesty's
message, made me, in some measure to smell that this whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
business might have that Bishop's hand in it; especially I
knowing in general, the disposition of the man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The minds of those that were Actors for the publishing of
the book, were not quiet at the Court, that the thing was not
despatched. Therefore, one day, the Duke said to the King,
"Do you see how this business is deferred! If more expedition
be not used, it will not be printed before the end of
the Term: at which time, it is fit that it be sent down into
the countreys [<i>counties</i>]." So eager was he, that either by my
credit, his undertakings might be strengthened; or at least,
I might be contemned and derided, as an unworthy fellow.</p>

<p>This so quickened the King, that the next message which
was sent by Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span>, was in some degree minatory,
"That if I did not despatch it, the King would take some
other course with me!"</p>

<p>When I found how far the Duke had prevailed; I thought
it my best way, to set down in writing, many objections,
wherefore the book was not fit to be published: which I did
modestly, and sent them to the King.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. (Page 2.) These words deserve to be well weighed,
<i>And whereas the Prince pleads not the Power of Prerogative</i>.</p>

<p>2. (Page 8.) <i>The King's duty is first to direct and make</i>
<i>Laws.</i> There is no law made till the King assent unto
it; but if it be put simply to <i>make Laws</i>, it will make
much startling at it.</p>

<p>3. (Page 10.) If <i>nothing may excuse from Active</i>
<i>Obedience, but what is against the Law of GOD, or of</i>
<i>Nature, or impossible</i>; how doth this agree with the first
fundamental position: (Page 5.) <i>That all subjects are</i>
<i>bound to all their Princes, according to the Laws and Customs</i>
<i>of the Kingdom wherein they live.</i></p>

<p>4. (Page 11.) This is a fourth Case of Exception. The
Poll Money, mentioned by him in <i>Saint <span class="smcap">Matthew</span></i>, was
imposed by the Emperor as a Conqueror over the Jews:
and the execution of it in England, although it was by
a Law, produced a terrible effect in King <span class="smcap">Richard II.</span>'s
time; when only it was used, for ought that appeareth.</p>

<p>5. (Page 12.) It is, in the bottom, <i>View of the reign</i>
<i>of <span class="smcap">Henry III.</span></i>; and whether it be fit to give such
allowance to the book; being surreptitiously put out?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
<p>6. (In the same page.) Let the largeness of those
words be well considered! <i>Yea, all Antiquity to be absolutely</i>
<i>for Absolute Obedience to Princes, in all Civil and Temporal</i>
<i>things.</i> For such cases as <span class="smcap">Naboth</span>'s Vineyard, may fall
within this.</p>

<p>7. (Page 14.) <span class="smcap">Sixtus V.</span> was dead before 1580.</p>

<p>8. (In the same page.) Weigh it well, How this
Loan may be called a Tribute! and when it is said, <i>We</i>
<i>are promised, it shall not be immoderately imposed</i>, how
agreeth that, with His Majesty's Commission and <i>Proclamation</i>,
which are quoted in the margent?</p></div>

<p>It should seem that this paper did prick to the quick; and
no satisfaction being thereby accepted, Bishop <span class="smcap">laud</span> is
called, and he must go to answer to it in writing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This man is the <i>only</i> inward [<i>intimate</i>] counsellor with
<span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>: sitting with him, sometimes, privately whole
hours; and feeding his humour with malice and spite.</p>

<p>His life in Oxford was to pick quarrels in the Lectures of
the Public Readers, and to advertise [<i>denounce</i>] them to the
then Bishop of <span class="smcap">Durham</span> [? <i><span class="smcap">T. Matthew</span>, or his successor,</i>
<i><span class="smcap">W. James</span></i>], that he might fill the ears of King <span class="smcap">James</span> with
discontents against the honest men that took pains in their
Places, and settled the truth (that he called Puritanism) in
their auditors.</p>

<p>He made it his work, to see what books were in the
press; and to look over <i>Epistles Dedicatory</i>, and <i>Prefaces to the</i>
<i>Reader</i>, to see what faults might be found.</p>

<p>It was an observation what a sweet man this was like[ly]
to be, that the first observable act that he did, was the
marrying of the Earl of <span class="smcap">D[evonshire]</span> to the Lady <span class="smcap">R[ich]</span>
[<i>See Vol. I. p. 483</i>]: when it was notorious to the world,
that she had another husband, and the same a nobleman,
who had divers children then living by her.</p>

<p>King <span class="smcap">James</span> did, for many years, take this so ill, that he
would never hear of any great preferment of him: insomuch
that Doctor <span class="smcap">Williams</span>, the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> (who taketh
upon him, to be the first promoter of him) hath many times
said "That when he made mention of <span class="smcap">Laud</span> to the King,
His Majesty was so averse from it, that he was constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
oftentimes to say that 'He would never desire to serve that
Master, which could not remit one fault unto his servant.'"</p>

<p>Well, in the end, he did conquer it, to get him [<i>on the 10th</i>
<i>October, 1621</i>] the Bishopric of <span class="smcap">St. Davids</span>: which he had
not long enjoyed; but he began to undermine his benefactor,
as, at this day, it appeareth.</p>

<p>The Countess of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> told <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>, that "St.
<span class="smcap">Davids</span> was the man that undermined him with her son."
And, verily, such is his aspiring nature, that he will under-work
any man in the world! so that he may gain by it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This man, who believeth so well of himself, framed an
Answer to my Exceptions.</p>

<p>But to give some countenance to it; he must call in three
other Bishops, that is to say, <span class="smcap">Durham</span>, <span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, tried men for such a purpose! and the style of the
Speech runneth, "We, and We." This seemed so strong a
Confutation, that, for reward of their service, as well as for
hope that they would do more, Doctor <span class="smcap">Neyle</span>, Bishop of
<span class="smcap">Durham</span>, and the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Bath</span>, were sworn of the Privy
Council.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The very day, being Sunday, Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span> was sent
unto me, with a writing: but finding me all in a sweat, by
a fit of the stone which was then upon me, he forbore, for
that time, to trouble me, and said, "That on the morrow,
he would repair to me again."</p>

<p>I got me to bed, and lying all that night in pain; I held it
convenient not to rise the next day.</p>

<p>And on the Monday, Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span> came unto me;
which was the eighth time that he had been with me, so
incessantly was I plied with this noble work.</p>

<p>I had shewed it [the <i>Apostolical Obedience</i>] to a friend or
two: whereof the one was a learned Doctor of Divinity; and
the other had served many times in Parliament with great
commendation. We all agreed that it was an idle work of
a man that understood not Logic, that evidently crossed
[<i>contradicted</i>] himself, that sometimes spake plausibly; and,
in the end of his Sermon, [it] fell so poor and flat, that it
was not worth the reading.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span> coming to my bedside, said, "That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
was sent again by the King, and had a paper to be shewed
unto me."</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> You see in what case I am, having slept
little all this last night; but nevertheless since you come
from the King, I will take my spectacles, and read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> No, my Lord! You may not read it, nor
handle it; for I have charge not to suffer it to go out of my
hands.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> How then, shall I know what it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> Yes, I have order to read it unto you! but I
may not part with it.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I must conceive, that if I do not assent to it,
His Majesty will give me leave to reply upon it; which I
cannot do, but in my study, for there are my books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> I must go with you into your study; and sit by
you, till you have done.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> It is not so hasty a work. It will require
time; and I have not been used to study, one sitting by me.
But first read it, I pray you!</p>

<p>The young gentleman read it from the one end to the
other; being two or three sheets of paper.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> This Answer is very bitter; but giveth me no
satisfaction. I pray you leave the writing with me; and I
shall batter it to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span> No, my Lord! I am forbidden to leave it
with you, or to suffer you to touch it.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> How cometh this about? Are the authors
of it afraid of it, or ashamed of it? I pray you tell His
Majesty that I am dealt with neither manly, nor scholar like.
Not manly, because I must fight with adversaries that I
know not: not scholar like, because I must not see what it
is that must confute me. It is now eight and forty years
ago [<i>i.e., in 1579</i>], that I came to the University; and, since
that time, I have ever loved a learned man. I have disputed
and written divers books, and know very well what appertaineth
to the Schools.</p>

<p>This is a new kind of learning unto me. I have formerly
found fault, that the author of this Sermon quoteth not the
places, whereupon he grounds his doctrine: and when I have
oft called for them, it is replied to me that "I must take
them upon the credit of the Writer," which I dare not do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
For I have searched but one place, which he quoted in
general, but sets down neither the words, nor the treatise,
nor the chapter; and I find nothing to the purpose for which
it is quoted: and therefore I have reason to suspect all the
rest.</p>

<p>I pray you, therefore, in the humblest manner, to commend
my service to the King my Master, and let him know
that, unless I may have all the quotations set down, that
I may examine them: and may have that Writing, wherein
I am so ill used: I cannot allow the book!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before I go further, it shall not be amiss to touch some
particulars of that which I sent in writing to the King.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The First was Page 2. These words deserve to be
well weighed. <i>And whereas the Prince pleads not the power</i>
<i>of Prerogative.</i></p></div>

<p>To this, Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span> said, "The King doth not plead
it."</p>

<p>But my reply was, "But what then, doth he coerce those
refractories? for I have not heard of any Law, whereby they
are imprisoned; and therefore I must take it to be by the
King's Prerogative."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Second (Page 8). <i>The King's duty is first to</i>
<i>direct and make Laws.</i> There is no Law made till the
King assent unto it; but if it be put simply to <i>make</i>
<i>Laws</i>, it will cause much startling at it.</p></div>

<p>To this I remember not any material thing was answered;
neither to the Third.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(Page 10.) <i>If nothing may excuse from Active Obedience,</i>
<i>but what is against the Law of GOD, or of Nature, or</i>
<i>impossible</i>; how doth this agree with the first fundamental
position: (Page 5.) <i>That all subjects are bound to all</i>
<i>their Princes, according to the Laws and Customs of the</i>
<i>kingdom wherein they live.</i></p>

<p>This is a fourth case of Exception.</p></div>

<p>And here, before I go to the rest, the Doctor did truly hit
upon a good point, in looking <i>to the Laws and Customs</i>, if he
could have kept him to it.</p>

<p>For in my memory, and in the remembrance of many
Lords and others that now live, Doctor <span class="smcap">Harsenet</span>, the then
Bishop of <span class="smcap">Chichester</span>, and now of <span class="smcap">Norwich</span>, in Parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>ment
time, preached at Whitehall, a sermon (which was
afterwards burned) upon the text, <i>Give unto <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>, the things</i>
<i>that be <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>'s!</i> wherein he insisted that "Goods and
Money were <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>'s; and therefore they were not to be
denied unto him."</p>

<p>At this time, when the whole Parliament took main offence
thereat, King <span class="smcap">James</span> was constrained to call the Lords and
Commons into the Banquetting House at Whitehall: and
there His Majesty called all, by saying "The Bishop only
failed in this, when he said <i>The goods were <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>'s</i>, he did
not add <i>They were his, according to the Laws and Customs of</i>
<i>the Country wherein they did live</i>."</p>

<p>So moderate was our <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span> then, as I myself saw and
heard, being then an Eye and Ear Witness: for I was then
Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Fourth. The Poll Money, in <i>Saint <span class="smcap">Matthew</span></i>,
was imposed by the Emperor, as a Conqueror over the
Jews: and the execution of it in England, although it
was by a Law, produced a terrible effect in <span class="smcap">Richard II.</span>'s
time; when only it was used, for ought that appeareth.</p></div>

<p>Here the Bishop, in the Paper, excepted divers things
"That sometimes among us, by Act of Parliament, strangers
are appointed to pay by the poll:" which agreeth not with
the Case: and that "It was not well to bring examples out
of weak times; whereas we live in better: but it was a
marvellous fault, the blame was not laid upon the rebels of
that Age."</p>

<p>Those are such poor things, that they are not worth the
answering.</p>

<p>But my Objection, in truth, prevailed so far, that in the
printed book, it was qualified thus: <i>Poll money, other persons,</i>
<i>and upon some occasions</i>.</p>

<p>Where, <i>obiter</i>, I may observe that my refusing to sign the
Sermon, is not to be judged by the printed book: for many
things are altered in one, which were in the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Fifth (Page 12). It is in the bottom, <i>View of</i>
<i>the reign of <span class="smcap">Henry III.</span></i>, whether it be fit to give such
allowance to the book; being surreptitiously put out?</p></div>

<p>To this, it was said, "That being a good passage out of a
blameworthy book, there was no harm in it."</p>

<p>But before the question of <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>'s treatise; the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
of <span class="smcap">Bath</span> himself, being with me, found much fault with that
Treatise, as being put out for a scandalous Parallel of those
times.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Sixth, in the same page. Let the largeness of
those words be well considered! <i>Yea, all Antiquity to be</i>
<i>absolutely for Absolute Obedience to Princes, in all Civil and</i>
<i>Temporal Things.</i> For such cases as <span class="smcap">Naboth</span>'s Vineyard
may fall within this.</p></div>

<p>Here the Bishop was as a man in a rage, and said, "That
it was an odious comparison! for it must suppose, that there
must be an <span class="smcap">Ahab</span>, and there must be a <span class="smcap">Jezebel</span>, and I cannot
tell what!"</p>

<p>But I am sure my Exception standeth true; and reviling
and railing doth not satisfy my argument. <i>All Antiquity</i>
taketh the Scripture into it: and if I had allowed that
proportion for good, I had been justly beaten with my own
rod.</p>

<p>If the King, the next day, had commanded me to send him
all the money and goods I had; I must, by mine own rule,
have obeyed him! and if he had commanded the like to all
the clergymen in England, by Doctor <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>'s proportion
and my Lord of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>'s allowing of the same; they
must have sent in all! and left their wives and children in a
miserable case.</p>

<p>Yea, the words extend so far, and are so absolutely delivered,
that by this Divinity, if the King should send to the
city of London, and the inhabitants thereof, commanding
them "to give unto him all the wealth which they have,"
they are bound to do it!</p>

<p>I know our King is so gracious, that he will attempt no
such matter: but if he do it not, the defect is not in these
flattering Divines! who, if they were called to question for
such doctrine, they would scarce be able to abide it.</p>

<p>There is a <i>Meum</i> and a <i>Tuum</i> in Christian commonwealths,
and <i>according to Laws and Customs</i>, Princes may dispose of it.
That saying being true, <i>Ad reges, potestas omnium pertinet, ad</i>
<i>singulos, proprietas</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Seventh (p. <a href="#Page_14">14</a>.), <span class="smcap">Pius V.</span> was dead before the
year 1580; they make no reply, but mend it in the
printed book; changing it into <span class="smcap">Gregory XIII.</span></p>

<p>To the last (on the same page). Weigh it well!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>How this Loan may be called a Tribute; and when it
is said, <i>We are promised it shall not be immoderately</i>
<i>imposed</i>. How that agreeth with His Majesty's Commission
and Proclamation, which are quoted in the
margent?</p></div>

<p>They make no answer but in the published Sermon, distinguish
a Tribute from a Loan or Aid: whereby they
acknowledge it was not well before, and indeed it was improper
and absurd: worthy of none but Doctor <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now delivered the grounds, whereupon I refused to
authorise this book: being sorry at my heart, that the King,
my gracious Master, should rest so great a building upon so
weak a foundation; the Treatise being so slender, and without
substance, but that it proceeded from a hungry man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If I had been in Council, when the Project for this Loan
was first handled, I would have used my best reasons to have
had it well grounded; but I was absent, and knew not whereupon
they proceeded: only I saw, it was followed with much
vehemency. And since it was put in execution, I did not
interpose myself to know the grounds of one, nor of the
other.</p>

<p>It seemed therefore strange unto me, that, in the upshot
of the business, I was called in, to make that good by
Divinity, which others had done; and must have no other
inducement to it, but Doctor <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>'s contemptible
treatise!</p>

<p>I imagined this, for the manner of the carriage of it, to be
somewhat like unto the Earl of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s case; who
having abused the wife of the Earl of <span class="smcap">Essex</span>, must have her
divorced from her husband, and must himself marry her.
And this must not be done; but that the Archbishop of
<span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> must ratify all, judicially!</p>

<p>I know the cases are different; but I only compare the
manner of the carriage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/554.png" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the approbation of the Sermon was by me refused, it
was carried to the Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>, who gave a great and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
stately allowance of it [<i>It was entered at Stationers' Hall,</i>
<i>under his authority, on the 3rd May, 1627</i>]: the good man
being not willing that anything should stick which was sent
unto him from the Court; as appeareth by the book which is
commonly called <i>The Seven Sacraments</i>, which was allowed
by his Lordship, with all the errors! which since that time
have been expunged and taken out of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But before this passed the Bishop's file, there is one
accident which fitly cometh in to be recounted in this place.</p>

<p>My Lord of <span class="smcap">London</span> hath a Chaplain, Doctor <span class="smcap">Worral</span> by
name; who is scholar good enough, but a kind of free fellow
like man, and of no very tender conscience.</p>

<p>Doctor <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>'s Sermon was brought unto him; and
"hand over head" as the proverb is, he approved it, and
subscribed his name unto it: but afterwards, being better
advised, he sendeth it to a learned gentleman of the Inner
Temple; and writing some few lines unto him, craveth his
opinion of that which he had done.</p>

<p>The Gentleman read it; but although he had promised to
return his judgement by letter, yet he refused so to do: but
desired Doctor <span class="smcap">Worral</span> would come himself. Which being
done, he spake to this purpose, "What have you done? You
have allowed a strange book yonder! which, if it be true,
there is no <i>Meum</i> or <i>Tuum</i>! no man in England hath anything
of his own! If ever the tide turns, and matters be
called to a reckoning; you will be hanged for publishing such
a book!"</p>

<p>To which, the Doctor answered, "Yea, but my hand is to
it! What shall I do?"</p>

<p>For that, the other replied, "You must scrape out your
name! and do not suffer so much as the sign of any letter to
remain in the paper!"</p>

<p>Which, accordingly he did; and withdrew his finger from
the pie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But what the Chaplain, well advised, would not do; his
Lord, without sticking, accomplished: and so, being unsensibly
hatched, it came flying into the world!</p>

<p>But in my opinion, the book hath persuaded very few
understanding men; and hath not gained the King, sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Pars Secunda.</i>
</h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/556h.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Hitherto</span>, I have declared, at length, all passages
concerning the Sermon; and, to my remembrance,
I have not quitted anything that was worthy the
knowing. I am now, in the second place, to shew
what was the issue of this not allowing the
worthy and learned Treatise.</p>

<p>In the height of this question, I privately understood from
a friend in the Court, that "for a punishment upon me, it
was resolved that I should be sent to Canterbury, and confined
there." I kept this silently, and expected GOD's
pleasure, yet laying it up still in my mind: esteeming the
Duke to be of the number of them, touching whom, <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span>
observeth, <i>that such as are false in their love, are true in their</i>
<i>hate</i>! But whatsoever the event must be, I made use of the
report, that <i>jacula pr&oelig;visa minus feriunt</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke, at the first, was earnest with the King, that I
must be presently sent away before his going to sea [<i>He left</i>
<i>Portsmouth, on the Rochelle Expedition, on the 27th June</i>].
"For," saith he, "if I were gone, he would be every day at
Whitehall, and at the Council table! and there, will cross all
things that I have intended."</p>

<p>To meet with this objection, I got me away to Croydon, a
month sooner than, in ordinary years, I have used to do; but
the Term was ended early, and my main [<i>strong</i>] fit of the
stone did call upon me to get me to the country, that there
on horseback, I might ride on the downs: which I afterwards
performed, and, I thank GOD! found great use of it in recovering
of my stomach, which was almost utterly gone.</p>

<p>The Duke hastened his preparations for the fleet: but still
that cometh in for one memorandum, "That if he were once
absent, there should no day pass over but that the Archbishop
would be with the King, and infuse things that would
be contrary to his proceedings."</p>

<p>What a miserable and restless thing ambition is! When
one talented, but as a common person; yet by the favour of
his Prince, hath gotten that Interest, that, in a sort, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
Keys of England hang at his girdle (which the wise Queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> would never endure in any subject); yet standeth
in his own heart, in such tickle terms, as that he feareth
every shadow, and thinketh that the lending of the King's
ear unto any grave and well seasoned report, may blow him
out of all! which in his estimation, he thinketh is settled on
no good foundation, but the affection of the Prince; which
may be mutable, as it is in all men, more or less. If a man
would wish harm unto his enemy; could he wish him a
greater torment, than to be wrested and wringed with ambitious
thoughts!</p>

<p>Well, at first, it went current, that "with all haste, I must
be doffed!" but, upon later consideration, "it must be stayed
till the Duke be at sea, and then put in execution by the
King himself; that, as it seemeth, <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> might be free
from blame, if any should be laid upon any person."</p>

<p>Hence it was, that, after his going, there was a new prosecution
of the Yorkshire men; and the refusing Londoners
were pursued more fervently than before: and it is very
likely that the arrow came out of the same quiver, that the
Bishop coming to the election at Westminster, was driven
back so suddenly to Bugden.</p>

<p>Take heed of these things, noble Duke! You put your
King to the worst parts! whereof you may hear, one day!
So when your Sovereign, in the Parliament time, had spoken
sharply to both Houses, commanding them "To go together
again, and to give more money!" and commanding them to
"meddle no more with the Duke of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>!" you
came, the next day, and thought to smooth all, taking the
glory of qualifying disturbances to yourself! Whereas, if
you read books of true State Government (wherewithal you
are not acquainted!), sweet things are personally to be acted
by Kings and Princes, as giving of honours, and bestowing of
noted benefits; and those things that are sour and distasting,
are to be performed by their Ministers. You go the contrary
way!</p>

<p>But as before the whole house falleth on fire, some sparks
do fly out; so, before the message of the King was brought
by the Secretary [of State], there were some inklings that
such a thing would follow. And upon the naming of me,
by occasion [<i>incidentally</i>], it was said by a creature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
Duke, that "It would not be long, before the Archbishop
should be sequestered!" that was the word. So well acquainted
are the Duke's followers, with great actions that are
likely to fall out in State.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Accordingly on Tuesday, the 5th of July, 1627, the Lord
<span class="smcap">Conway</span> [Secretary of State] came to me to Croydon, before
dinner-time; "having travelled," as he said, "a long journey
that morning, even from Oatlands thither."</p>

<p>He would say nothing till he had dined. Then, because
he was to return to Oatlands that night, I took him into the
gallery: and when we were both sat down, we fell to it, in
this manner.</p>

<p>My Lord! I know you, coming from Court, have somewhat
to say to me.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> It is true, My Lord! and I am the most unwilling
man in the world, to bring unpleasing news to any
Person of Quality, to whom I wish well; and especially to
such a one, as of whose meat I have eaten, and been merry
at his house: but I come from the King, and must deliver
his pleasure (I know who you are! and much more) with
very civil language.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I doubt not, my Lord! but you have somewhat
to say; and therefore, I pray you, in plain terms, let me
have it!</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> It is then His Majesty's pleasure, that you
should withdraw yourself unto Canterbury! for which, he
will afford you some convenient time.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> Is that it! Then I must use the words of
the Psalmist, "He shall not be afraid of any evil tidings; for
his heart standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD!" But,
I pray you, what is my fault that bringeth this upon me?</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> The King saith, you know!</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> Truly, I know none, unless it be that I am
lame; which I cannot help. It is against my will, and I am
not proud of it.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> The King bade me tell you, "That if any expostulation
were used"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> No, I will not use any expostulation! If it
be his pleasure, I will obey. I know myself to be an honest
man, and therefore fear nothing; but, my Lord! do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
think it is for the King's service, in this sort, to send me
away?</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> No, by GOD! I do not think it: and so, yesterday,
I told the King with an oath; but he will have it so.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I must say, as before, "He shall not be afraid of
any evil tidings; for his heart standeth fast, and he believeth in
the LORD!" But, I pray you, my Lord! is the King precisely
set upon my going to Canterbury. There are questions in
law between me and that town, about the liberties of my
Archbishopric; which I, by my oath, am bound to maintain:
and if I should be among them, I have many adversaries of
the citizens. I have there some tenants, and the Dean and
Chapter are interested in the question. I would be unwilling
that my servants and their people should fall together by the
ears, while I am in the town.</p>

<p>His Majesty knoweth this difference to be between us, by
the token that a suit, which I lately brought against them, by
a <i>Quo Warranto</i> in the King's Bench, was stopped: justice
being denied me, which is not usual to be denied to any
subject; and the King well knoweth, by whose means it
was stayed.</p>

<p>I have therefore another house called Foord, five miles
beyond Canterbury, and more out of the way. His Majesty
may be pleased to let me go thither.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> I can say nothing to that, but I will acquaint
the King with it; and I conceive nothing to the contrary, but
that His Majesty will yield so much unto you.</p>

<p>I have a second Charge to deliver unto you, and that is
that "His Majesty will not have you, from henceforth, to
meddle with the High Commission. He will take care that
it shall be done otherwise."</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I do not doubt but it shall be better managed
than it hath been by me: and yet, my Lord! I will tell you,
that, for these many years that I have had the direction of
that Court, the time is to come, that ever honest man did find
fault that he had not there justice done.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> It is now Vacation time, and so consequently
little to do; and by Michaelmas, His Majesty may set all in
order.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> I am sorry the King proceedeth thus with me,
and letteth me not know the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Although I have no commission to tell you so.
It is for a book which you would not allow, which concerned
the King's service.</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> If that be it; when I am questioned for it, I
doubt not but to give an honest answer.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> You will never be questioned for it!</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> Then am I the more hardly dealt withal; to
be Censured, and not called to my answer.</p>

<p><i>Secretary.</i> Well, my Lord! I will remember that of Foord:
and will your Grace command me any more service?</p>

<p><i>Archbishop.</i> No, my Lord! but GOD be with you! Only
I end where I began, with the words of the Prophet, "He
shall not be afraid for any evil tidings; for his heart standeth
fast, and believeth in the LORD!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It comforted me not a little, that the word was now out:
"My confining must be, for not allowing of a book!" I had
much ado to forbear smiling when I heard it: because now
it was clear, it was not for felony or treason that was laid to
my charge, nor for intelligence with the Spaniards or French,
nor for correspondency [<i>correspondence</i>] with Jesuits and
Seminary Priests; I thank GOD for that!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had almost forgotten that, among many other memorable
speeches that passed between us, I used this one, that "Peradventure,
the King might be offended at me, because I was
no more present at the matter of the Loan; but," said I,
"my lameness hindered me therein; and I hoped thereby to
do my Master better service. Because if ever course were
taken to reconcile the King and his people (which if it be
not, this Kingdom will rue it in the end!), I would hope,
among many others, to be a good instrument therein, since
my hand hath not been in those bitternesses, which have, of
late, fallen out."</p>

<p>"You say well!" said the Secretary; "would you that I
should tell the King so much?"</p>

<p>"Yea," said I, "if you please, I hold it not unfit that His
Majesty should know it."</p>

<p>What he reported therein, I know not: but matters proceeded
in the former course, as if there were no regard had
of any such thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lord <span class="smcap">Conway</span> being gone from me for two or three
days; I expected to hear the resolution [as] to what place in
Kent, I should betake myself. And receiving no news, I
tossed many things in my mind, as perhaps that the King
desired to hear somewhat from the Duke, how he sped on
his journey [<i>expedition</i>]; or that peradventure he might alter
his purpose, upon report of my ready obeying; or that it
might so fall out, that some of the Lords at the Court,
understanding, upon the Secretary's return from Croydon,
that which was formerly concealed from them, might infuse
some other counsels into the King.</p>

<p>These thoughts I revolved. At last, not forgetting the courses
of the Court, and imprinting that into my heart, that <i>there</i>
<i>was no good intended towards me, but that any advantage would</i>
<i>be taken against me</i>, I sent a man to Whitehall, whither the
King was now come for a night or two, and by him, I wrote
to the Lord <span class="smcap">Conway</span>, in these words</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>My very good Lord</i></span>,<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><i><span class="smcap">I</span> do not forget the message, which you brought unto me</i>
<i>on Thursday last; and because I have heard nothing</i>
<i>from you since that time, I send this messenger on</i>

<i>houses where I must remain. There belong to the Archbishopric,</i>
<i>three houses in Kent: one at Canterbury; another five miles</i>

<p><i>I pray your Lordship to let me know His Majesty's pleasure,</i>
<i>whether he will leave the choice of any of those houses to reside in,</i>

<p><i>I have reason to know the resolution thereof: because I must</i>

<p>He made my servant stay: and when he had gone up to
know the King's pleasure, he returned me the answer
following.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i><span class="smcap">May it please your Grace</span></i>,<br />
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/562i.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><i><span class="smcap">I</span> am ashamed, and do confess my fault, that I wrote not</i>

<i>forget; but the continual oppression of business would</i>
<i>not permit me to advertise to your Grace, the King's Answer.</i></p>

<p><i>His Majesty heard seriously your professions and answers, and</i>
<i>commanded me to signify unto you that "He knew not the present</i>
<i>differences between you and the town</i> [i.e., of Canterbury]; <i>and</i>
<i>if he had, he would not have cast you into that inconvenience."</i>

<p>I could not but observe therein that passage, that the King
<i>doth expect your Grace will so govern it, as His Majesty shall not</i>
<i>need to warn you a second time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p>

<p>I needed no interpreter to expound those words, and therefore
did take order that one of my officers was presently
despatched unto Foord, to see the house ready.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While necessaries were caring for, and I lay for some days
at Croydon, and afterwards at Lambeth; the city of London
was filled with the report of "my confining" (for so they did
term it), and divers men spake diversely of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will not trouble myself to mention some idle things;
but some other of them require a little consideration. A
main matter, that the Duke was said "to take in ill part,"
was the resort which was made to my house, at the times
of dinner and supper, and that, oftentimes, of such as did not
love him.</p>

<p>My answer unto that is, That, by nature, I have been given
to keep a house according to my proportion, since I have had
any means, and GOD hath blessed me in it. That it is a
property, by Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> required in a Bishop, that "He
should be given to hospitality"; that it is another of his
rules, "Let your conversation be without covetousness!"
and those things, I had in mine eyes. Besides I have no
wife, nor child: and as for my kindred, I do that for them
which I hold fit; but I will not rob the Church, nor the poor,
for them!</p>

<p>Again, it is so rare a fault in these things, that men not
feeding on the King's meat, but of their own charge, should
frankly entertain their friends when they come unto them;
that I deserve to be pardoned for it!</p>

<p>But this is not all. When King <span class="smcap">James</span> gave me the
Bishopric, he did once between him and me, and another
time before the Earl of <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, charge me that "I should
carry my house nobly!" that was His Majesty's word, "and
live like an Archbishop!" which I promised him to do. And
when men came to my house, who were of all Civil sorts, I
gave them friendly entertainment: not sifting what exceptions
the Duke made against them; for I knew he might as undeservedly
think ill of others, as he did of me. But I meddled
with no man's quarrels: and if I should have received none,
but such as cordially, and in truth had loved him; I might
have gone to dinner many times without company!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>There, frequented me Lords Spiritual and Temporal, divers
Privy Councillors, as occasion served, and men of the highest
rank: where, if the Duke thought that we had busied ourselves
about him, he was much deceived. Yet, perhaps the
old saying is true, "A man who is guilty of one evil to himself;
thinketh that all men that talk together, do say somewhat
of him!" I do not envy him that happiness; but let it
ever attend him!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As for other men, of good sort, but of lesser quality; I have
heard some by name, to whom exception has been taken: and
these are three. I know from the Court by a friend, that my
house, for a good space of time, hath been watched; and I
marvel that they have not rather named sixty, than three.</p>

<p>The First of these, is Sir <span class="smcap">Dudley Digges</span>, a very great
mote in the Duke's eye, as I am informed: for it is said that
this Knight hath paid him in Parliament, with many sharp
speeches. If this be so, yet what is that to me? He is of
age to answer for himself!</p>

<p>But in the time of the late Parliament, when the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Carlisle</span> came unto me, and dealt with me thereabouts; I
gave him my word, and I did it truly, that I was not acquainted
with these things: only, being sick as I was, I had
in general given him advice that he should do nothing that
might give just offence to the King. And I have credibly
heard that when Sir <span class="smcap">Dudley</span> was last in the Fleet, committed
from the Council table; he was much dealt with, to know
whether he was not instigated by me to accuse the Duke in
Parliament: the Knight, with all the protestations and assurances
that could come from a Gentleman, acquitted me of
the part and whole: wherein he did me but right.</p>

<p>And I do remember, when that man, now so hated! was a
great servant of the Duke. So that if he have now left him,
it cannot but be presumed that it is for some unworthy
carriage, which the Gentleman conceiveth hath, by that Lord,
been offered unto him.</p>

<p>Moreover, how can I but imagine the words and actions of
Sir <span class="smcap">Dudley Digges</span> have been ill interpreted and reported;
when I myself saw the Duke stand up nine times in a morning,
in a Parliament House, to fasten upon him words little
less, if at all less than treason; when by the particular votes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
of all the Lords and Commons in both Houses, he was quit
[<i>acquitted</i>] of those things, which the other would have
enforced upon him. And a little while before, he was hastily
clapped into the Tower; and within a day or two released
again, because nothing was proved against him!</p>

<p>And I assure you, I am so little interested in his actions,
that, to this day, I could never learn the reason why he was
imprisoned in the Fleet; although he was kept there for seven
or eight weeks.</p>

<p>I distinguish the King, from the Duke of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>.
The one is our Sovereign, by the laws of GOD and men! the
other, a subject! as we are: and if any subject do impeach
another, though of different degrees; let the party grieved,
remedy himself by Law, and not by Power!</p>

<p>But, to speak further for this Knight, I may not forget that
when he was publicly employed (one time to the Hague, a
second time to Muscovia, and thirdly into Ireland about
Affairs of the State), such opinions as were then held of his
good endeavours.</p>

<p>As for my own part, ever since the days of Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
I have been nearly acquainted with him. He was my
pupil at Oxford, and a very towardly one; and this knowledge,
each of the other, hath continued unto this time. He calleth
me, Father; and I term his wife, my daughter. His eldest
son is my godson; and their children are in love accounted
my grandchildren.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Second that I have heard named, was Sir <span class="smcap">Francis</span>
<span class="smcap">Harrington</span>: a Gentleman, whom for divers years, I have
not seen; and who, for ought I know, was never in my house
but once in his life.</p>

<p>The Third was Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Wentworth</span> [<i>who after <span class="smcap">Felton</span></i>
<i>murdered <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> on the 23rd August, 1628, went over</i>
<i>to the Court, and ultimately became Earl of <span class="smcap">Strafford</span></i>]; who
had good occasion to send unto me, and sometimes to see me;
because we were joint executors to Sir <span class="smcap">George Savile</span>, who
married his sister, and was my pupil at Oxford. To whose
son also, Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Wentworth</span> and I were Guardians,
as may appear in the Court of Wards; and many
things passed between us in that behalf: yet, to my
remembrance, I saw not this gentleman but once, in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
three-quarters of a year last past [<i>i.e., since October, 1626</i>]: at
which time, he came to seek his brother-in-law, the Lord
<span class="smcap">Clifford</span>, who was then with me at dinner at Lambeth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For one of the punishments laid upon me, it was told me
by the Lord <span class="smcap">Conway</span>, that "I must meddle no more with
the High Commission." Accordingly, within a few days
after, a Warrant is sent to the Attorney-General, that the
Commission must be renewed, and the Archbishop must be
left out. This, under hand, being buzzed about the town,
with no small mixture of spite; I conceived it to be agreeable
to [<i>correspond with</i>] the proceedings with [<i>against</i>] the
Lords and Gentlemen, who refused to contribute to the Loan:
they all being laid aside in the Commissions for Lieutenancy,
and of the Peace, in their several counties.</p>

<p>For my part, I had no cause to grieve at this, since it was
His Majesty's pleasure! but it was, by the actors therein
understood otherwise; they supposing that this power gave
me the more authority and splendour in the Church and
Commonwealth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To deliver therefore, truly, the state of this question. It
cannot be denied but that it was a great point of policy for
the establishing of order in the Ecclesiastical, and consequently
Civil Estate also, to erect such a Court: whereby
Churchmen [<i>clergy</i>] that exorbitated [<i>exceeded bounds</i>] in any
grievous manner, might be castigated and rectified; and
such sort of crimes in the laity might be censured [<i>judged</i>]
as were of Ecclesiastical Cognisance. And, verily, this is of
great use in the kingdom, as well for cherishing the study of
the Civil Law, as otherwise; so that it be kept incorruptible,
and with that integrity as so grave a Meeting and Assembly
requireth. This was principally my care; who took much
pains and spent much money that, in fair and commendable
sort, justice was indifferently [<i>impartially</i>] administered to
all the King's people that had to do with us.</p>

<p>But every one might see that this was to my singular
trouble! For besides that to keep things in a straight course,
sometimes in fits of the gout I was forced to be carried into
the Court by my servants; where I could not speak much,
but with difficulty: I was, at no time, free from petitions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
from examinations; from signing of warrants to call some,
to release others; from giving way to speeding, and forwarding
Acts of Court. Suitors, as their fashion is, being so importunate
as that, in summer and winter, in the day and in
the night, in sickness and health, they would not be denied!</p>

<p>These things were daily despatched by me out of Duty;
and more, out of Charity; no allowance of pay being from
the King, or of fee from the subject to us that were the
Judges. Nay, I may say more. The holding of that Court,
in such sort as I did, was very expenseful to me, out of my
private purse, in giving weekly entertainment to the Commissioners.
The reason whereof was this. King <span class="smcap">James</span>
being desirous, when he made me Archbishop, that all
matters should gravely and honourably be carried, directed
me that I should always call some of the Bishops that were
about London, and some Divines and Civilians [<i>Doctors of</i>
<i>the Civil Law</i>], that, by a good presence, causes might be
handled for the reputation of the action: and willed me
withal, to imitate therein the Lord Archbishop <span class="smcap">Whitgift</span>,
who invited weekly some of the Judges to dinner, the rather
to allure them thither. This advice proceeded from [<span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Bridgman</span>] the Bishop of Durham that now is; which was not
ill, if it came from a good intention.</p>

<p>I obeyed it, singly; and did that which was enjoined.
But whereas in those times, the Commissioners were but
few: since that time there hath been such an inundation
of all sorts of men into that Company [<i>i.e., the High Commission</i>],
that, without proportion, both Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, Commissioners and not Commissioners, resorted
thither; and divers of them brought so many of their men,
that it was truly a burthen to me. I think it may, by my
Officers, be justified upon oath, that since I was Archbishop,
the thing alone hath cost me, out of my private estate [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>official income as Archbishop</i>], one and a half thousand
pounds; and if I did say two thousand pounds, it were not
much amiss: besides all the trouble of my servants, who,
neither directly nor indirectly, gained sixpence thereby in a
whole year, but only travail and pains for their Master's
honour; and of that, they had enough! my houses being like
a great host[el]ry every Thursday in the Term; and for my
expenses, no man giving me so much as thanks!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this being the true case, if the Church and Commonwealth
be well provided for, in the administration of
justice, and regard be had of the public [welfare]; can any
discreet man think that the removing of me from this molestation,
is any true punishment upon me? I being one that
have framed myself to Reality, and not to Opinion: and
growing more and more in years, and consequently into
weakness; having before surfeited so long of worldly shews,
whereof nothing is truly gained temporally but vexation of
spirit, I have had enough of these things, and do not dote
upon them. The world, I hope, hath found me more stayed
and reserved in my courses.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, what was expedient for this, was despatched
by me while I lived at Lambeth and Croydon; albeit I went
not out of door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Yea, but you were otherwise inutile, not coming to the
Star Chamber, nor to the Council table?"</p>

<p>My pain or weakness by the gout, must excuse me herein.
When I was younger, and had my health, I so diligently
attended at the Star Chamber, that, for full seven years, I
was not one day wanting.</p>

<p>And for the Council table, the same reason of my indisposition
may satisfy. But there are many other things
that do speak for me.</p>

<p>The greatest matters there handled, were for money, or
more attempts of war.</p>

<p>For the one of these, we of the Clergy had done our parts
already: the Clergy having put <i>themselves</i> into payments of
Subsidy, by an Act of Parliament; not only for these last two
years (when the Temporalty lay in a sort dry), but yet there
are three years behind, in which our payments run on, with
weight enough unto us. And no man can justly doubt but
my hand was in those grants, in a principal fashion.</p>

<p>And concerning the Provisions for War, I must confess
my ignorance in the facts thereof. I knew not the grounds
whereon the controversies were entered, in general. I
thought that before wars were begun, there should be store of
treasure; that it was not good to fall out with many great
Princes at once; that the turning of our forces another way,
must needs be some diminution from the King of Denmark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
who was engaged by us into the quarrel for the Palatinate
and Germany, and hazarded both his person and dominions
in the prosecution of the question. These matters I thought
upon, as one that had sometimes been acquainted with
Councils; but I kept my thoughts unto myself.</p>

<p>Again, I was never sent for to the Council table but I
went; saving one time, when I was so ill that I might not
stir abroad.</p>

<p>Moreover, I was sure that there wanted no Councillors at
the Board; the number being so much increased as it was.</p>

<p>Besides, I had no great encouragement to thrust my
crazy body abroad; since I saw what little esteem was
made of me, in those things which belonged to mine own
occupation. With Bishoprics and Deaneries, or other
Church places I was no more acquainted; than if I had
dwelt at Venice, and understood of them but by some
<i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> had the managing of these
things, as it was generally conceived. For what was he not
fit to determine in Church or Commonwealth, in Court or
Council, in peace or war, at land or at sea, at home or in
foreign parts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montague</span> had put out [<i>published</i>] his Arminian book.
I, three times, complained of it: but he was held up against
me; and by the Duke magnified, as a well deserving man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cosens</span> put out his treatise, which they commonly call
<i>The Seven Sacraments</i>: which, in the first edition had many
strange things in it, as it seemeth. I knew nothing of it, but
as it pleased [<span class="smcap">John Bridgman</span>] my Lord of <span class="smcap">Durham</span>, and
[<span class="smcap">William Laud</span>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Bath</span>, so the world did
read.</p>

<p>We were wont, in the High Commission, to repress obstinate
and busy Papists.</p>

<p>In the end of King <span class="smcap">James</span> his time, a Letter was brought
me, under the hand and signet of the King, that "We must
not meddle with any such matter: nor exact the twelve
pence for the Sunday, of those which came not to the
Church (with which forfeit, we never meddled)." And this
was told us to be, in contemplation of a marriage intended
with the Lady <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, the Daughter of France.</p>

<p>After the death of King <span class="smcap">James</span>, such another Letter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
brought from King <span class="smcap">Charles</span>; and all execution against
Papists was suspended.</p>

<p>But when the Term was at Reading, by open divulgation
in all Courts under the Great Seal of England, we and all
magistrates were set at liberty to do as it was prescribed by
law. And our pursuivants must have their warrants again,
and take all the priests they can; whereof Master <span class="smcap">Cross</span>
took fourteen or fifteen in a very short space.</p>

<p>Not long after, all these are set free! and Letters come from
the King, under his royal signet, that "All warrants must be
taken from our messengers, because they spoiled the Catholics,
and carried themselves unorderly unto them, especially the
Bishops' pursuivants:" whereas we had in all, but two;
<span class="smcap">Cross</span>, my messenger, for whom I did ever offer to be answerable;
and <span class="smcap">Thomlinson</span>, for whom my Lord of <span class="smcap">London</span>,
I think, would do as much. But the caterpillars, indeed, were
the pursuivants used by the sectaries [<i>Puritans</i>]: men of no
value, and shifters in the world; who had been punished and
turned away by us, for great misdemeanours.</p>

<p>But truth of religion and GOD's service was wont to overrule
human policies, and not to be overruled; and I am
certain that things best prosper, where those courses are
held. But be it what it may be, I could not tell what to
make of this Variation of the Compass, since it was only
commanded unto me, to put such and such things in execution:
but I never understood anything of the counsel,
whereby I might give my judgement how fit or unfit they
were, or might speak to alter the tenour; whereunto, in
former times, I had been otherwise used. Variety [<i>diversity</i>]
of reasons breedeth variety of actions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the matter of the Loan, I knew not, a long time, what
to make of it. I was not present when the advice was taken,
I understood not what was the foundation whereupon the
building was raised; neither did ever any of the Council
acquaint me therewith.</p>

<p>I saw, on the one side, the King's necessity for money;
and especially it being resolved that the war should be pursued.
And, on the other side, I could not forget that in the
Parliament, great sums were offered, if the Petitions of the
Commons might be hearkened unto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>It still ran in my mind, that the old and usual way was
best; that in kingdoms, the harmony was sweetest where the
Prince and the people tuned well together; that, whatsoever
pretence of greatness [he might have], he was but an unhappy
man! that set the King and the Body of the Realm at
division; that the people, though not fit to be too much
cockered, yet are they that must pray! that must pay! that
must fight for their Princes! that it could not be, but [that]
a man so universally hated in the kingdom as the Duke was,
must (for the preservation of himself) desperately adventure
on anything! if he might be hearkened unto.</p>

<p>These meditations I had with myself, and, GOD knoweth!
I frequently, in my prayers, did beg that he whom these
things did most concern, would seriously think upon them.</p>

<p>It ran in my mind, that this new device for money could
not long hold out! that then, we must return into the Highway,
whither it were best, to retire ourselves betimes; the
shortest errors being the best.</p>

<p>But these thoughts, I suppressed within my soul: neither
did I ever discourage any man from lending, nor encourage
any man to hold back; which I confidently avouch.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Commission for the Loan, I was sent
for, from Croydon. It seemed to me a strange thing: but I
was told there that "howsoever it shewed, the King would
have it so; there was no speaking against it."</p>

<p>I had not heard [<i>i.e., at any time before</i>] that men, throughout
the kingdom, should lend money against their will! I
knew not what to make of it! But when I saw in the instructions
that refusers should be sent away for soldiers to
the King of Denmark; I began to remember <span class="smcap">Uriah</span>, that
was sent in the forefront of the battle: and, to speak truth, I
durst not be tender in it.</p>

<p>And when, afterwards, I saw that men were to be put to
their oath, "With whom they had had conference, and
whether any did dissuade them?" and yet further beheld
that divers were to be imprisoned; I thought this was somewhat
a New World! yet, all this while, I swallowed my own
spittle, and spake nothing of it to any man.</p>

<p>Nay, when after some trial in Middlesex; the first sitting
was for Surrey, in my House [<i>the Palace</i>] at Lambeth; and
the Lords were there assembled, with the Justices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
whole county: I gave them entertainment in no mean
fashion.</p>

<p>And I sat with them, albeit I said nothing; for the confusion
was such, that I knew not what to make of it. Things
went on every day, and speech was of much money to be
raised out of some counties, yet afterwards it was not so
readily paid as preferred [? <i>deferred</i>]: and, at length, some
refused, even in London itself, and Southwark; besides many
gentlemen of special rank, and some Lords, as it was said.
And though it was reported that "they were but a contemptible
company!" yet the prisons in London demonstrated that they
were not a very few, but persons both of note and number.</p>

<p>The Judges, besides, concurring another way, that "They
could not allow the legality of the demand, and the enforcement
that is used thereupon," did somewhat puzzle me, for
being too busy in promoting of that for which I might, one
day, suffer. Yet, hitherto, I remained silent; hoping that
time would break that off which was almost come to an
absolute period [<i>full stop</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But instead of this, by the permission of GOD, I was
called up to the King, to look clearly into the question.
When the allowance of <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>'s pamphlet was put upon
me, I had then some reason, out of the grounds of that
sermon to fear (and I pray GOD that my fear was in vain!)
that the Duke had a purpose to turn upside down the Laws,
and the whole Fundamental Courses, and Liberties of the
Subject: and to leave us, not under the Statutes and Customs
which our progenitors enjoyed; but to the Pleasure of Princes,
of whom, as some are gentle and benign, so some others, to
ingreat themselves [<i>make themselves greater</i>], might strain more
than the string will bear.</p>

<p>Besides, now it came in my heart, that I was present at
the King's Coronation: where many things, on the Prince's
part, were solemnly promised; which, being observed, would
keep all in order, and the King should have a loving and
faithful people, and the Commons should have a kind and
gracious King.</p>

<p>The contemplations of these things made me stay my
judgement, not any unwillingness to do my Prince any dutiful
service: whom I must, and do honour above all the creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
in the world, and will adventure as far for his true good, as
any one whatsoever.</p>

<p>But I am loath to plunge myself, so over head and ears,
in these difficulties, that I can neither live with quietness of
conscience, nor depart out of the world with good fame and
estimation. And, perhaps, my Sovereign (if, hereafter, he
looked well into this paradox) would, of all the world hate
me! because one of my profession, age, and calling, would
deceive him; and, with base flattery, swerve from the truth.
<i>The hearts of Kings are in the hands of GOD, and He can turn</i>
<i>them as rivers of water.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">I</span> draw to a conclusion. Only repute it not amiss,
because so much falleth in here, to observe a few
words of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span>&mdash;not as now he
is, but as he was in his rising.</p>

<p>I say nothing of his being in France, because I was not
present; and divers others there be, that remember it well:
but I take him at his first repair to Court [<i>in 1614</i>].</p>

<p>King <span class="smcap">James</span>, for many insolences, grew weary of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>:
and the Kingdom groaning under the Triumvirate of
<span class="smcap">Northampton</span>, <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>, and <span class="smcap">Somerset</span> (though <span class="smcap">Northampton</span>
soon after died [<i>in June, 1614</i>]) was glad to be rid of
him.</p>

<p>We could have no way so good to effectuate that which
was the common desire, as to bring in another in his room.
"One nail," as the proverb is, "being to be driven out by
another."</p>

<p>It was now observed that the King began to cast his eye
upon <span class="smcap">George Villiers</span>, who was then Cup-bearer, and
seemed a modest and courteous youth. But King <span class="smcap">James</span>
had a fashion, that he would never admit any to nearness
about himself, but such a one as the Queen should commend
unto him, and make some suit on his behalf: that if the
Queen, afterwards, being ill intreated, should complain of
this "Dear One!"; he might make his answer, "It is 'long
of yourself! for you were the party that commended him
unto me!" Our old Master took delight strangely, in things
of this nature.</p>

<p>That noble Queen, who now resteth in heaven, knew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
husband well; and having been bitten with Favourites, both
in England and Scotland, was very shy to adventure upon
this request.</p>

<p>King <span class="smcap">James</span>, in the meantime, more and more loathed
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>; and did not much conceal it, that his affection
increased towards the other.</p>

<p>But the Queen would not come to it; albeit divers Lords
(whereof some are dead; and some, yet living) did earnestly
solicit Her Majesty thereunto.</p>

<p>When it would not do; I was very much moved [<i>i.e.,</i>
<i>desired by others</i>] to put to, my helping hand: they knowing
that Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span> was graciously pleased to give me more
credit than ordinary; which, all her attendants knew, she
continued to the time of her death.</p>

<p>I laboured much, but could not prevail. The Queen oft
said to me, "My Lord! you and the rest of your friends
know not what you do! I know your Master better than
you all! For if this young man be once brought in, the first
persons that he will plague, must be you that labour for him!
Yea, I shall have my part also! The King will teach him
to despise and hardly intreat us all; that he [<i><span class="smcap">Buckingham</span></i>]
may seem to beholden to none but himself."</p>

<p>Noble Queen! how like a Prophetess or Oracle did you
speak!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, we were still instant, telling Her
Majesty that "the change would be for the better! for
<span class="smcap">George</span> was of a good nature, which the other was not; and
if he should degenerate, yet it would be a long time before he
were able to attain to that height of evil, which the other
had."</p>

<p>In the end, upon importunity, Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span> condescended
[<i>agreed to it</i>]; and so pressed it with the King, that he
assented thereunto: which was so stricken, while the iron
was hot, that, in the Queen's Bedchamber, the King
knighted him with a rapier which the Prince [<span class="smcap">Charles</span>] did
wear. And when the King gave order to swear him of the
Bedchamber, <span class="smcap">Somerset</span> (who was near) importuned the
King with a message that he might be only sworn a Groom.
But myself and others, that were at the door, sent to Her
Majesty that "She would perfect her work, and cause him to
be sworn a Gentleman of her Chamber!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a Lord, or two, living that had a hand in this
achievement. I diminish nothing of their praise for so
happy a work: but I know my own part best; and, in the
word of an honest man, I have reported nothing but truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> went in with the King; but no sooner he got
loose, but he came forth unto me, in the Privy Gallery, and
there embraced me. He professed that "He was so infinitely
bound unto me that, all his life long, he must honour me as
his father." And now, he did beseech me, that I would give
him some Lessons how he should carry himself.</p>

<p>When he had earnestly followed this chase, I told him,
I would give him three short lessons, if he would learn them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The First was, That, daily, upon his knees, he
should pray to GOD to bless the King his Master, and
to give him (<i><span class="smcap">George</span></i>) grace studiously to serve and
please him.</p>

<p>The Second was, That he should do all good offices
between the King and the Queen; and between the King
and the Prince.</p>

<p>The Third was, That he should fill his Master's ears
with nothing but truth.</p></div>

<p>I made him repeat these three things unto me: and then
I would have him, to acquaint the King with them! and
so tell me, when I met him again, what the King said unto
him.</p>

<p>He promised he would. And the morrow after, Master
<span class="smcap">Thomas Murray</span> (the Prince's Tutor) and I standing together,
in the gallery at Whitehall, Sir <span class="smcap">George Villiers</span>
coming forth, and drawing to us, he told Master <span class="smcap">Murray</span>
how much he was beholden unto me, and that I had given
him certain instructions: which I prayed him to rehearse:
as, indifferently well he did, before us. Yea, and that he
had acquainted the King with them; who said, "They were
instructions worthy of an Archbishop, to give to a young
man."</p>

<p>His countenance of thankfulness continued for a few days,
but not long! either to me or any others, his well wishers.
The Roman historian, <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span>, hath somewhere a note that
"Benefits, while they may be requited, seem courtesies; but
when they are so high, that they cannot be repaid, they
prove matters of hatred."</p>

shall appear.</p>

<p>Not that I am willing to be the author of

and so profitable a relation. Remarkable, as extending
to manifest the power and glory of GOD, who hath variety of
supportation in store to sweeten affliction, and make all endurances
subject to fortitude and patience: profitable, as being
thus far exemplary, to teach all men of action and employment,
not to despair in distress; and to know thus much, that brave
attempts are compassed by resolution and industrious employment,
and whether they thrive or not, yet shall the
enterprise be Charactered with a worthy exploit. And if it
end with success; O how shall the Actors be remembered to
posterity! and make their fame immortal that, either purchased
their liberty, even out of fire; or delivered themselves

with all the attributes belonging to so immense a Deity, shall
be made manifest; by the other, the weak brother shall be
comforted, the strong confirmed, the wavering reduced, the
faint-hearted erected, and the presumptuous moderated. By
both, Religion shall have a sweet passage in the consciences
of men; and men made the happy instruments of GOD's
glory, and their own increases of good example and imitation.</p>

<p>And thus much for Preamble or Introduction. Now, to
the matter itself!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the year 1621, the 1st of November, there was one
<span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> (born in Rochester, and dwelling three and
twenty years in Plymouth) employed to the Straits of Gibraltar,
by Master[s] <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, and <span class="smcap">Steven Treviles</span>,
Merchants of Plymouth; and freighted in a bark called the
<i>Nicholas</i> of Plymouth, of the burden of 40 tons: which had
also in her company, another ship of Plymouth, called the
<i>George Bonaventure</i>, of 70 tons burden or thereabouts; which,
by reason of her greatness beyond the other, I will name the
Admiral [<i>flag-ship</i>], and <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>'s bark shall, if you
please, be the Vice-Admiral.</p>

<p>These two, according to the time of the year, had a fair
passage; and, by the 18th of the same month, came to a
place at the entering of the Straits, named Trafalgar; but the
next morning [<i>19th November, 1621</i>], being in the sight of
Gibraltar, at the very mouth of the Straits, the watch descried
five sail of ships. Who, as it seemed, used all the
means they could to come near us; and we, as we had cause,
used the same means to go as far from them; yet did their
Admiral take in both his topsails, that either we might not
suspect them, or that his own company might come up the
closer together. At last, perceiving us [to be] Christians,
they fell from devices, to apparent discovery of hostility, and
making out against us. We again suspecting them [to be]
pirates, took our course to escape from them; and made all
the sails we possibly could for Terriff or Gibraltar: but all we
could do, could not prevent their approach. For, suddenly,
one of them came right over against us to windward; and so
fell on our quarter. Another came up on our luff, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
threatened us there. And, at last, all five chased us; making
great speed to surprise us.</p>

<p>Their Admiral was called <i>Callfater</i>; having upon her main-topsail,
two top-gallant sails, one above another. But
whereas we thought them all five to be Turkish Ships of War;
we afterwards understood that two of them were their prizes
(the one, a small ship of London, the other of the West
Country), that came out of the Quactath, laden with figs
and other merchandise, but now [were] subject to the fortune
of the sea, and the captivity of pirates. But to our business!</p>

<p>Three of these ships got much upon us; and so much, that, ere
half the day was spent, the Admiral, which was the best sailer,
fetched up the <i>George Bonaventure</i>, and made booty of it.</p>

<p>The Vice-Admiral again, being nearest unto the lesser bark
whereof <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> was Master, shewed him the force of
a stronger arm; and by his Turkish name, called <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>,
commanded him, in like sort, to strike his sails, and submit
to his mercy: which, not to be gainsaid, nor prevented, was
quickly done. And so <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, with his bark, was as quickly
taken; although the Rear-Admiral, being the worst sailer of
the three, called <i>Riggiprise</i>, came not in, till all was done.</p>

<p>The same day, before night, the Admiral (either loath to
pester himself with too much company, or ignorant of the
commodity [which] was to be made by the sale of English prisoners,
or daring not to trust them in his company for fear of
mutinies, and exciting others to rebellion) set twelve persons
who were in the <i>George Bonaventure</i>, and divers other English
whom he had taken before, on the land, to try their fortunes
in an unknown country.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>, the Vice-Admiral, that had taken <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, would not so dispense with his men; but commanded
him, and five more of his company to be brought
aboard his ship: leaving in his bark, three men and his boy,
with thirteen Turks and Moors, who were, questionless, sufficient
to overmaster the others, and direct the bark to harbour.</p>

<p>Thus they sailed direct for Argier [<i>Algiers</i>]. But, the
night following followed them with great tempest and foul
weather, which ended not without some effect of a storm: for
they lost the sight of <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s bark, called the <i>Nicholas</i>;
and, in a manner, lost themselves (though they seemed safe
a shipboard) by fearful conjecturing what should become of us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, by the 22nd of the same month, they, or we
(choose you whether! for I would not be mistaken in altering
the persons, by either naming the first for the third, or
the third for the first; but only make the discourse equal,
by setting down the business honestly and truly as it
chanced) arrived in Argier; and came in safety within the
Mole: but found not our other bark there; nay, though we
earnestly inquired after the same.</p>

<p>Yet heard we nothing to our satisfaction; but much
matter was ministered to our discomfort and amazement.
For although the Captain and our Overseers were loath we
should have any conference with our countrymen; yet did we
adventure to inform ourselves of the present affairs, both of
the town and of the shipping. So that finding many English
at work in other ships, they spared not to tell us the danger
we were in, and the mischiefs we must needs incur; as being
sure, "If we were not used like slaves, to be sold as slaves: for
there had been five hundred brought into the market for the
same purpose, and above a hundred handsome youths compelled
to turn Turks; all English!" Yet, like good Christians,
they bade us "Be of good cheer! and comfort ourselves in
this! That GOD's trials were gentle purgations; and these
crosses were but to cleanse the dross from the gold, and bring
us out of the fire again, more clear and lovely."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet, I must needs confess, that they afforded us reason for
this cruelty; as if they determined to be revenged of our last
attempt to fire their ships in the Mole [<i>by Sir <span class="smcap">Robert</span></i>
<i><span class="smcap">Mansell</span>'s fleet in May, 1621. See J. B's.</i> Algiers Voyage,
1621], and therefore protested "to spare none! whom they
could surprise, and take alone; but either to sell them for
money or to torment them to serve their own ends."</p>

<p>Now their customs and usages, in both these, were in this
manner.</p>

<p>First, concerning the first. The Bashaw [<i>Pasha</i>] had the
overseeing of all prisoners who were presented unto him, at
their first coming into the harbour; and so chose one out of
every eight, for a present or fee to himself. The rest were
rated by the Captains, and so sent to the market to be sold:
whereat, if either there were repining, or any drawing back;
then certain Moors and Officers attended, either to beat you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
forward, or thrust you in the sides with goads. And this
was the manner of the selling of slaves.</p>

<p>Secondly, concerning their enforcing them, either to turn
Turk or to attend their impieties: although it would make a
Christian's heart bleed to hear of the same; yet must the
truth not be hid, nor the terror left untold. They commonly
lay them on their naked backs or bellies, beating them so
long till they bleed at the nose and mouth: and if yet they
continue constant, then they strike the teeth out of their
heads, pinch them by their tongues, and use many other
sorts of tortures to convert them. Nay, many times, they
lay them, their whole length, in the ground, like a grave;
and so cover them with boards, threatening to starve them,
if they will not turn. And so, many, even for fear of torment
and death, make their tongues betray their hearts to
a most fearful wickedness: and so are circumcised with new
names, and brought to confess a new religion. Others again,
I must confess, who never knew any god but their own
sensual lusts and pleasures, thought that any religion would
serve their turns: and so, for preferment or wealth, very
voluntarily renounced their faith, and became Renegadoes; in
despite of any counsel which seemed to intercept them.</p>

<p>And this was the first news we encountered with, at our
coming first to Argier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 26th of the same month, <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>' bark, with his
other three men and a boy, came safe into the Mole; and so
were put all together, to be carried before the Bashaw; but that
they took the Owner's Servant [? <i>Supercargo</i>] and <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s
boy, and, by force and torment, compelled them to turn Turks.</p>

<p>Then were they in all, seven English, besides <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>: of whom the Bashaw took one; and sent the rest
to their Captains, who set a valuation upon them. So the
soldiers hurried us, like dogs, into the market; where, as men
sell hackneys in England, we were tossed up and down, to see
who would give most for us. And although we had heavy
hearts, and looked with sad countenances; yet many came to
behold us; sometimes taking us by the hand, sometimes turning
us round about, sometimes feeling our brawns and naked
arms: and so beholding our prices written in our breasts, they
bargained for us accordingly; and, at last, we were all sold, and
the soldiers returned with their money to their Captains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> was the last that was sold, by reason of
his lame hand. He was bought by the Captain that took him,
even that dog <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>! who (better informing himself of
his skill fit to be a Pilot, and his experience to be an Overseer)
bought him and his Carpenter at very easy rates. For,
as we afterwards understood by divers English Renegadoes,
he paid for <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> but 150 Doublets, which make, of
English money, &pound;7 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Thus was he and his Carpenter, with divers other slaves,
sent into his ship to work; and employed about such affairs
as belonged to the well rigging and preparing the same.</p>

<p>But the villainous Turks perceiving his lame hand,
and that he could not perform so much as other slaves,
quickly complained to their Patron: who as quickly apprehended
the inconvenience: whereupon he sent for him, the
next day, and told him, "He was unserviceable for his present
purpose! and therefore unless he could procure &pound;15 of the
English there, for his ransom: he would send him up into
the country, where he should never see Christendom again,
and endure the extremity of a miserable banishment."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But see how GOD worketh all for the best for His servants!
and confoundeth the presumption of tyrants, frustrating their
purposes, to make His wonders known to the sons of men!
and relieves His people, when they least think of succour and
releasement!</p>

<p>Whilst <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> was thus terrified with the dogged
answer of <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>, the <i>Exchange</i> of Bristol, a ship
formerly surprised by the pirates, lay all unrigged in the
harbour, till, at last, one <span class="smcap">John Goodale</span>, an English Turk,
with his confederates (understanding she was a good sailer,
and might be made a proper Man of War) bought her from the
Turks that took her; and prepare her for their own purposes.</p>

<p>Now the Captain that set them on work, was also an
English Renegado, by the name of <span class="smcap">Rammetham Rise</span>, but by
his Christian name <span class="smcap">Henry Chandler</span>: who resolved to make
<span class="smcap">Goodale</span>, Master over her.</p>

<p>And because they were both English Turks (having the
command, notwithstanding, of many Turks and Moors) they
concluded to have all English slaves to go in her; and for
their gunners, English and Dutch Renegadoes: and so they
agreed with the Patrons of nine English slaves and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
French for their ransoms; who were presently employed to
rig and furnish the ship for a Man of War.</p>

<p>And while they were thus busied, two of <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>'s,
men (who were taken with him), were also taken up to serve
in this Man of War: their names, <span class="smcap">James Roe</span> and <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Davies</span>, the one dwelling in Plymouth; and the other in Foy,
where the Commander of this ship was also born, by which
occasion they became acquainted. So that both the Captain
and the Master promised them good usage, upon the good
service they should perform in the voyage; and withal, demanded
of <span class="smcap">Davies</span> if he knew of any Englishman to be bought,
that could serve them as a Pilot; both to direct them out of
harbour, and conduct them in their voyage. For, in truth,
neither was the Captain a mariner, nor any Turk in her of
sufficiency to dispose of <i>navigate</i> her through the Straits in
security; nor oppose any enemy that should hold it out
bravely against them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davies</span> quick replied that, "As far as he understood,
<span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span> would sell <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>, his Master, and Commander
of the bark which was taken. A man every way
sufficient for sea affairs, being of great resolution and good
experience; and for all he had a lame hand, yet had he a
sound heart and noble courage for any attempt or adventure."</p>

<p>When the Captain understood thus much, he employed
<span class="smcap">Davies</span> to search for <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>; who, at last lighting upon
him, asked him, "If the Turk would sell him?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> suddenly answered, that "By reason of his lame
hand he was willing to part with him; but because he had
disbursed money for him, he would gain something by him;
and so priced him at 300 doublets, which amounteth to &pound;15
English; which he must procure, or incur sorer endurances."</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Davies</span> had certified thus much, the Turks a
shipboard conferred about the matter; and the Master,
whose Christian name was <span class="smcap">John Goodale</span>, joined with
two Turks who were consorted with him, and disbursed
100 doublets a piece, and so bought him of <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>:
sending him into the said ship called the <i>Exchange</i> of
Bristol; as well to supervise what had been done, as to order
what was left undone; but especially to fit the sails, and to
accommodate [<i>fit out</i>] the ship. All which, <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> was very
careful and indulgent in; not yet thinking of any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
plot of deliverance, more than a general desire to be freed
from this Turkish slavery, and inhuman abuses.</p>

<p>By the 7th of January [1622], the ship was prepared, with
twelve good cast pieces, and all manner of munition and
provision which belonged to such a purpose: and, the same
day, hauled out of the Mole of Argier, with this company, and
in this manner.</p>

<p>There were in her sixty-three Turks and Moors, nine
English slaves and one French, four Hollanders that were
free men (to whom the Turks promised one prize or other,
and so to return to Holland; or if they were disposed to go
back again for Argier, they should have great reward, and no
enforcement offered, but continue, as they would, both their
religion and their customs): and for their gunners, they had
two of our soldiers, one English and one Dutch Renegado.
And thus much for the company.</p>

<p>For the manner of setting out, it was as usual, as in other
ships; but that the Turks delighted in the ostentatious
bravery of their streamers, banners, and topsails: the ship
being a handsome ship, and well built for any purpose. The
slaves and English were employed under hatches, about the
ordnance and other works of order, and accommodating
[<i>berthing</i>] themselves.</p>

<p>All which, <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> marked, as supposing it an intolerable
slavery to take such pains, and be subject to such
dangers; and still to enrich other men, and maintain their
voluptuous lives; returning themselves as slaves, and living
worse than dogs amongst them. Whereupon, after he had
conceited the indignity and reproach of their baseness, and
the glory of an exploit that could deliver himself and the rest
from this slavish captivity; being very busy among the
English in pulling of ropes, and placing of ordnance, he burst
into these, or such like abrupt speeches: "O hellish slavery!
to be thus subject to dogs! to labour thus to enrich infidels,
and maintain their pleasures! to be ourselves slaves, and
worse than the outcast of the world! Is there no way of
releasement? no device to free us from this bondage? no
exploit, no action of worth to be put in execution, to make us
renown in the world, and famous to posterity? O GOD!
strengthen my heart and hand, and something shall be done
to ease us of these mischiefs, and deliver us from these cruel
Mahomedan dogs!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p>The other slaves pitying his distraction, as they thought,
bade him, "Speak softly! least they should all fare the worse
for his distemperature!"</p>

<p>"The worse!" quoth <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, "what can be worse?
Death is the determiner of all misery! and torture can last
but a while! But to be continually a dying; and suffer all
indignity and reproach: and, in the end, to have no welcome
but into the House of Slaughter or Bondage, is insufferable!
and more than flesh and blood can endure! And therefore,
by that salvation which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath brought, I wilt
either attempt my deliverance at one time or another, or
perish in the enterprise! but if you would be contented to
hearken after a release, and join with me in the action; I
would not doubt of facilitating the same, and shew you away
to make your credits thrive by some work of amazement, and
augment your glory in purchasing your liberty!"</p>

<p>"Ay, prithee, be quiet!" said they again, "and think not
of impossibilities! Yet, if you can but open such a door of
reason and probability that we be not condemn for desperate
and distracted persons, in pulling the sun (as it were) out of
the firmament; we can but sacrifice our lives! and you may
be sure of secrecy and taciturnity!"</p>

<p>"Now, blessed be my genius!" said <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, "that ever
this motive was so opportunely preferred! and therefore we
will be quiet a while, till the iron be hotter, that we may not
strike in vain."</p>

<p>The 15th January, the morning water [<i>tide</i>] brought us
near Cape de Gatte, hard by the shore; we having in our
company, a small Turkish Ship of War that followed us out
of Argier, the next day: and now joining us she gave us
notice of seven small vessels, six of them being Sattees and
one a Polacca; who very quickly appeared in sight, and so
we made towards them.</p>

<p>But having more advantage of the Polacca than the rest,
and loath to lose all, we both fetched her up, and brought
her past hope of recovery; which when she perceived, rather
than she would voluntarily come into the slavery of the Mahomedans,
she ran herself ashore; and so all the men forsook her.</p>

<p>We still followed as near as we durst, and for fear of
splitting [<i>i.e., on the rocks</i>], let fall our anchors; making out
[<i>sending</i>] both our boats, wherein were many musketeers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
some English and Dutch Renegadoes: who came aboard
home at their <i>cong&eacute;</i> [<i>entered the vessel, without opposition</i>], and
found three pieces of ordnance, and four murtherers [<i>see</i>
<i>Vol. I. p. 500</i>], but straightway threw them all overboard, to
lighten the ship. So they got her off, being ladened with hides,
and logwood for dyeing: and presently sent her to Argier,
taking nine Turks and one English slave out of one ship, and
six out of the lesser; which, we thought, sufficient to man her.</p>

<p>But see the chance! or, if you will, how fortune smiled on
us. In the rifling of this <i>Catalcynia</i> [? Catalonian], the Turks
fell at variance, one with another; and in such a manner
that we divided ourselves [<i>parted company</i>]: the lesser ship returned
to Argier and our <i>Exchange</i> took the opportunity of
the wind, and plied out of the Straits; which rejoiced <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> very much, as resolving on some stratagem, when
opportunity should serve.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Turks began to murmur, and would
not willingly go into the <i>Marr Granada</i>, as the phrase is
amongst them; notwithstanding the Moors, being very superstitious,
were contented to be directed by their <i>Hoshca</i>, who,
with us, signifieth a Witch [<i>or rather Wizard</i>]: and is of
great account and reputation amongst them, as not going in
any great vessel to sea without one; and observing whatsoever
he concludeth, out of his divination.</p>

<p>The ceremonies he useth are many; and when they come
into the ocean, every second or third night, he maketh his
conjuration. He beginneth, and endeth with prayer, using
many characters, and calling upon GOD by divers names.</p>

<p>Yet, at this time, all that he did, consisteth in these particulars.
Upon the sight, and, as we were afraid, the chasing
of two great ships, being supposed to be Spanish Men of War,
a great silence is commanded in the ship; and when all is
done, the company giveth as great a screech; the Captain
still coming to <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> and sometimes making him to
take in all his sails, and sometimes causing him to hoist them
all out, as the Witch findeth by his book and presages.</p>

<p>Then have they two arrows and a curtleaxe lying on a
pillow, naked. The arrows are, one for the Turks, and the
other for the Christians. Then the Witch readeth, and the
Captain or some other, taketh the arrows in their hand by the
heads, and if the arrow for the Christians cometh over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
head of the arrow for the Turks, then do they advance their
sails, and will not endure the fight, whatsoever they see;
but if the arrow of the Turks is found, in the opening of the
hand, upon the arrow of the Christians, they will then stay
and encounter with any ship whatsoever.</p>

<p>The curtleaxe is taken up by some child that is innocent,
or rather, ignorant of the ceremony; and so laid down again.
Then they do observe whether the same side is uppermost,
which lay before: and so proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>They also observe lunatics and changlings, and the Conjurer
writeth down their sayings in a book, grovelling on the
ground, as if he whispered to the Devil, to tell him the truth:
and so expoundeth the Letter, as it were, by inspiration.</p>

<p>Many other foolish rites they have, whereon they do dote
as foolishly; and whereof, I could entreat more at large, but
this shall suffice at this time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst he was thus busied, and made demonstration that all
was finished; the people in the ship gave a great shout, and
cried out "A sail!" "a sail!": which, at last, was discovered
to be another Man of War of Turks. For he made towards
us, and sent his boat aboard us; to whom, our Captain
complained that being becalmed by the Southern Cape [? <i>of</i>
<i>Portugal, i.e., Cape St. Vincent</i>]; and having "made" no voyage,
the Turks denied to go any further northward; but the Captain
resolved not to return to Argier, except he could obtain
some prize worthy his endurances; but rather to go to Salle,
and sell his Christians to victual his ship. Which the other
Captain apprehended for his honour; and so persuaded the
Turks to be obedient unto him: whereupon followed a pacification
amongst us; and so that Turk took his course for the
Straits, and we put up northward, expecting the good hour
of some beneficial booty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All this while our slavery continued; and the Turks, with
insulting tyranny, set us still on work in all base and servile
actions; adding stripes and inhuman revilings, even in our
greatest labour. Whereupon <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> resolved to obtain
his liberty and surprise the ship, providing ropes with
broad specks of iron, and all the iron crows, with which he
knew a way, upon the consent of the rest, to ram up or tie
fast their scuttles, gratings, and cabins; yea, to shut up the
Captain himself with all his consorts: and so to handle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
matter, that, upon the watchword given, the English being
masters of the Gunner Room, ordnance and powder, they
would either blow them into the air; or kill them, as they
adventured to come down, one by one, if they should, by any
chance, open their cabins.</p>

<p>But because he would proceed the better in his enterprise,
as he had somewhat abruptly discovered himself to the nine
English slaves, so he kept the same distance with the four
Hollanders that were free men: till finding them coming
somewhat towards them; he acquainted with them the whole
conspiracy; and they affecting the plot, offered the adventure
of their lives in the business.</p>

<p>Then, very warily, he undermined the English Renegado
which was the Gunner; and three more, his associates: who,
at first, seemed to retract.</p>

<p>Last of all, were brought in the Dutch Renegadoes, who
were also in the Gunner Room; for always there lay twelve
there, five Christians, and seven English and Dutch Turks.</p>

<p>So that, when another motion had settled their resolutions,
and <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>'s constancy had put new life, as it were,
into the matter: the four Hollanders very honestly, according
to their promise, sounded the Dutch Renegadoes; who, with
easy persuasion, gave their consent to so brave an enterprise.</p>

<p>Whereupon <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>, not caring whether the English
Gunners would yield or not, resolved, in the Captain's
morning watch, to make the attempt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, you must understand that where the English slaves lay
[<i>in the Gun Room</i>], there hung up always four or five crows of
iron; being still under the carriages of the pieces. And, when
the time approached, being very dark: because <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>.
would have his crow of iron ready, as other things were, and
other men prepared, in their several places; in taking it out of
the carriage, by chance, it hit on the side of the piece, making
such a noise, that the soldiers hearing it, awaked the Turks,
and bade them come down. Whereupon, the Boatswain of
the Turks descended, with a candle, and presently searched
all the slaves' places, making much ado of the matter: but
finding neither hatchet, nor hammer, nor anything else to
move suspicion of the enterprise more than the crow of iron,
which lay slipped down under the carriages of the pieces;
they went quietly up again, and certified the Captain, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
had chanced, who satisfied himself that it was a common
thing to have a crow of iron slip from his place.</p>

<p>But by this occasion, we made stay of our attempt; yet
were resolved to take another or a better opportunity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only I must tell you, what <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> would have done,
if this accident had not happened. He was fully minded, with
some others, with their naked knives in their hands, to press
upon the Gunner's breast and the other English Renegadoes,
and either force them to consent to their designs, or to cut
their throats; first telling them plainly that "They had vowed
to surprise the ship, and, by GOD's assistance, to obtain their
liberty; and therefore Die! or Consent (when you hear the
watchword given, <i>For GOD! and King <span class="smcap">James</span>!</i> and <i>St.</i>
<i><span class="smcap">George</span> for England!</i>) [that] you presently keep your places!
and advise to execute what you are commanded!"</p>

<p>But as you have heard, GOD was the best physician to
our wounded hearts; and used a kind of preventing physic,
rather than to cure us so suddenly. So that, out of His
Providence, perceiving some danger in this enterprise, He
both caused us to desist; and, at last, brought our business
to a better period, and fortunate end.</p>

<p>For we sailed still more northward, and <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> had
more time to tamper with his Gunners, and the rest of the
English Renegadoes: who very willingly, when they considered
the matter, and perpended the reasons, gave way unto
the project; and with a kind of joy seemed to entertain the
motives. Only they made a stop at [<i>as to</i>] the first onset, who
should begin the enterprise, which was no way fit for them
to do; because they were no slaves, but Renegadoes, and
so had always beneficial entertainment amongst them: but
when it was once put in practice, they would be sure not to
fail them; but venture their lives for GOD and their country.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> had heard them out, he much liked their
contradiction [<i>reservation</i>]; and told them plainly, "He did
require no such thing at their hands! but the slaves and
himself would first sound the channel, and adventure the
water." And so, after reciprocal oaths taken, and hands given;
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, once again, lay in wait for the fittest opportunity.
But once again he was disappointed; and a suspicious
accident brought him to re-collect his spirits anew, and study
on the danger of the enterprise: and thus it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Renegado Gunner had protested secrecy, by all
that might induce a man to bestow some belief upon him;
he presently went up the scottle [<i>scuttle</i>]; but stayed not
aloft a quarter of an hour. Nay, he came sooner down; and
in the Gunner Room sat by <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, who tarried for him,
where he left him.</p>

<p>He was no sooner placed, and entered into some conference,
but there entered into the place, a furious Turk, with his
knife drawn, and presented it to <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s body: who verily
supposed he intended to kill him; as suspicious that the
Gunner had discovered something. Whereat <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> was
much moved; and so hastily asked, "What the matter
meant? or whether he would kill him or not?" observing his
countenance; and (according to the nature of jealousy) conceiting
that his colour had a passage of change, whereby his
suspicious heart condemned him for a traitor; but that, at
more leisure, he sware the contrary, and afterwards proved
faithful and industrious in the enterprise. And for the present,
he answered <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, in this manner, "No, Master!
be not afraid! I think, he doth but jest!"</p>

<p>With that, <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> gave back a little, and drew
out his knife; stepping also to the Gunner's sheath, and
taking out his, whereby he had two knives to one: which,
when the Turk perceived, he threw down his knife, saying,
"He did but jest with him!"</p>

<p>But, as I said, when the Gunner perceived, <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> took
it so ill, he whispered something in his ear, that, at last,
satisfied him: calling heaven to witness that "He never
spake a word of the enterprise, nor ever would! either to the
prejudice of the business, or danger of his person."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> kept the knives in his sleeve,
all night, and was somewhat troubled; for that he had made
so many acquainted with an action of such importance: but,
the next day, when he perceived the coast clear, and that
there was no further cause for fear, he somewhat comforted
himself; and grew bolder and bolder in disposing the affairs
of the ship. Only it grieved him that his enterprises were
thus procrastinated: whereby the Mahomedan tyranny increased,
and the poor slaves even groaned again under the
burden of their bondage; and thought every day a year, till
something was put in execution for their deliverance. For it was
now full five weeks since <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> first projected the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<p>All this while, <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> drew the Captain to lie for the
Northern Cape [? <i>Cape Finisterre</i>], assuring him, that thereby
he should not miss purchase; which accordingly fell out, as a
wish would have it: but his drift was, in truth, to draw him from
any supply or second [<i>reinforcement</i>] of Turks, if GOD should
give way to their enterprise, or success to the victory.</p>

<p>Yet, for the present, the 6th of February, being twelve
leagues from the Cape, we descried a sail; and presently, took
the advantage of the wind in chasing her, and at last fetched
her up, making her strike all her sails: whereby we knew
her to be a bark belonging to Torbay, near Dartmouth, that
came from Averare, laden with salt.</p>

<p>Ere we had fully despatched, it chanced to be foul weather;
so that we could not, or at least would not make out our
boat; but caused the Master of the bark to let down his, and
come aboard with his company; there being in the bark but
nine men, and one boy.</p>

<p>And so the Master, leaving his Mate with two men in the
same, came himself, with five men and the boy unto us;
whereupon our Turkish Captain sent ten Turks to man her:
amongst whom, were two Dutch and one English Renegado,
who were of our confederacy, and acquainted with us.</p>

<p>But when <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> saw this partition of his friends, before
they could hoist out their boat for the bark; he made means
to speak with them, and told them plainly that "He would
prosecute the matter, either that night, or the next: and
therefore, whatsoever came of it, they should acquaint the
English with his resolution, and make towards England;
bearing up the helm, whiles the Turks slept and suspected
no such matter. For, by GOD's grace, in his first watch,
about midnight, he would shew them a light; by which
they might understand that the enterprise was begun, or, at
least, in a good forwardness for the execution."</p>

<p>So the boat was let down, and they came to the bark of
Torbay; where the Master's Mate being left, as before you
have heard, apprehended quickly the matter, and heard the
discourse with amazement.</p>

<p>But time was precious, and not to be spent in disputing or
casting of doubts, whether the Turks that were with them
were able to master them or not; being seven to six: considering
they had the helm of the ship, and the Turks being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
soldiers, and ignorant of sea affairs, could not discover
whether they went to Argier or not; or, if they did, they
resolved, by <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s example, to cut their throats, or cast
them overboard. And so I leave them to make use of the
Renegadoes' instructions: and return to <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master of the bark of Torbay and his company were
quickly searched, and as quickly pillaged, and dismissed to
the liberty of the ship; whereby <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> had leisure to
entertain him with the lamentable news of their extremities,
and the adventure of their voyages: whereby he understood of
his first setting out from the West country, of his taking and
surprising at sea by <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>; of his twice being sold as a
slave, and so continuing to his heart-burning and excruciation;
of the making [of] the <i>Exchange</i> of Bristol, a Man of War,
which they were now in; of the Captain and Master, who
were both English Renegadoes; of the cruelty of the Turks
in general, and his own fortunes in particular; of his
admission into the ship as a Pilot; of the friendship which
passed between him and the Hollanders; of the imparting of
the secret of surprising the ship, both to the slaves and Christian
Renegadoes; of their consent and courageous apprehension
of the matter; of the first attempt, and their twice disappointing;
of his still resolution presently [<i>at once</i>] to put it in
practice; of his last acquainting [of] the Dutch Renegadoes
who went aboard his bark; and in a word, of every particular
which was befitting to the purpose.</p>

<p>"Yea," he told him, that "that night, he should lose the
sight of them, for they would make the helm for England;"
and that he "would, that night, and evermore, pray
for their good success and safe deliverance."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Master of the Bark of Torbay had heard him
out, and that his company were partakers of his story;
they all became silent: not either diffident of his discourse
or afraid of the attempt; but as wondering at the goodness
of GOD, and His mercy in choosing out such weak instruments
to set forth His glory.</p>

<p>"True," quoth <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, when he found them coming
towards him, "it is so! For mark but the circumstance of
the matter! and you shall see the very finger of GOD to
point us out our deliverance! When we came into the main
ocean to hunt after prizes, according to the nature of pirates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
and that I resolved on the enterprise, there were sixty-five
Turks in our ship, and only seventeen of our confederacy.
Then it pleased GOD to abate us ten of the Turks, who were
sent with the Polacca before recited. And when we were
disappointed again of our purposes; you see now what hath
chanced! We are rid of more Turks, and welcome you, as a
new supply! so that, if you please, we shall be twenty-four
strong; and they, in all, are but forty-five. Be therefore
courageous! and let us join heart, hand, and foot together
that we may execute this brave attempt for GOD's glory,
our country's honour, the good example to others, our own
deliverance, and (if we may not be counted vainglorious) our
everlasting memory."</p>

<p>By that time he had finished this discourse also, the Master
of the Bark and his company resolved to assist him: as projecting
[<i>foreseeing</i>] the misery and wretchedness they should
endure by being slaves to the Turks, and the happiness of
their liberty besides the reputation of the enterprise. As for
death, it was in community to all men: and so in the hands
of GOD to dispose, at His pleasure; and either could not
happen before the hour of limitation, or could not be prevented.
For human policy must submit to Divine Providence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet to shew himself an understanding man, he demanded
of <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, "What weapons he had? and in what manner
he would execute the business?"</p>

<p>To which, he answered, that "He had ropes and iron
hooks, to make fast the scottels, gratings, and cabins. He
had also in the Gunner Room two curtleaxes, and the slaves had
five crows of iron before them. Besides, in the scuffling, they
made no question [of taking] of some of the soldiers' weapons."</p>

<p>Then for the manner, he told them, "They were sure of
the ordnance, the Gunner Room, and the powder: and so
blocking them up, would either kill them, as they came
down; or turn the ordnance against their cabins, or blow
them into the air by one stratagem or other." Thus were
they contented, on all sides; and resolved to the enterprise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, being the 7th of February, the prize of
Torbay was not to be seen or found; whereat the Captain
began to storm and swear, commanding <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> to search
the seas up and down for her: who bestowed all that day in
that business, but to little purpose; whereupon, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
humour was spent, the Captain pacified himself, as conceiting
he should be sure to find her at Argier. But, by the permission
of the Ruler of all actions, that Argier was England!
and all his wickedness frustrated.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> being now startled, lest he should return in this
humour, for the Straits; the 8th of February went down into the
hold, and finding a great deal of water below; told the Captain
of the same: adding that "It did not come to the pump!"
which he did very politicly, that he might remove the ordnance.</p>

<p>For when the Captain asked him the reason, he told him,
"the ship was too far after the head."</p>

<p>Then, he commanded to use the best means he could, to
bring her in order.</p>

<p>"Sure, then," quoth <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, "we must quit our cables, and
bring four pieces of ordnance after [<i>abaft</i>]; and that would bring
the water to the pump." Which was presently put in practice.</p>

<p>So the pieces being usually made fast thwart the ship, we
brought two of them, with their mouths right before the
biticle [<i>binnacle</i>]. And because the Renegado Flemings
would not begin [<i>i.e., the fight</i>]; it was thus concluded.</p>

<p>That the ship having three decks; we that did belong to
the Gunner Room should be all there, and break up the
lower deck. The English slaves, who always lay in the
middle deck should do the like, and watch the scuttles.
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> himself prevailed with the Gunner, for so much
powder as should prime the pieces: and so told them all, there
was no better watchword, nor means to begin, than, upon
the report of the piece, to make a cry and screech [<i>shout</i>], "For
GOD, and King <span class="smcap">James</span>!" and "St. <span class="smcap">George</span> for England!"</p>

<p>When all things were prepared, and every man resolved,
as knowing what he had to do; and the hour when it should
happen, to be two in the afternoon: <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> advised the
Master Gunner to speak to the Captain, that the soldiers
might attend on the poop, which would bring the ship after
[<i>more aft</i>]. To which the Captain was very willing; and
upon the Gunner's information, the soldiers gat themselves
to the Poop to the number of twenty; and five or six went
into the Captain's cabin, where always lay divers curtleaxes
and some targets [<i>shields</i>].</p>

<p>And so we fell to work to pump the water; and carried the
matter fairly till the next day, which was spent as the former;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
being the 9th of February, and, as GOD must have the
praise! the triumph of our victory.</p>

<p>For by that time, all things were prepared, and the
soldiers got upon the Poop as the day before. To avoid suspicion,
all that did belong to the Gunner Room went down;
and the slaves in the middle deck, attended [to] their business.
So that we may cast up our account in this manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First, nine English slaves, besides <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span>; five
of the Torbay men and one boy; four English Renegadoes
and two Dutch; four Hollanders: in all, four and
twenty and a boy.</p></div>

<p>So that lifting up our hearts and hands to GOD, for the
success of the business; we were wonderfully encouraged,
and settled ourselves till the report of the piece gave us
warning of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Now, you must consider that, in this company, were two
of <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s men, <span class="smcap">James Roe</span> and <span class="smcap">John Davies</span>, whom he
brought out of England; and whom the fortune of the sea
brought into the same predicament with their Master.</p>

<p>These were employed about noon, being, as I said, the 9th
of February, to prepare their matches; while all the Turks,
or at least most of them, stood on the Poop, to weigh down
the ship as it were, to bring the water forward to the pump,
the one brought his match lighted between two spoons, the
other brought his, in a little piece of a can. And so, in the
name of GOD! the Turks and Moors being placed as you
have heard, and five and forty in number; and <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>
having proined the touchholes: <span class="smcap">James Roe</span> gave fire to one
of the pieces, about two o'clock in the afternoon; and the
confederates, upon the warning, shouted most cheerfully.</p>

<p>The report of the piece did tear and break down all the
biticle and compasses; and the noise of the slaves made all
the soldiers amazed at the matter: till seeing the quarter of
the ship rent and feeling the whole body to shake under them;
understanding the ship was surprised, and the attempt tended
to their utter destruction, never bear robbed of her whelps
was so fell and mad!</p>

<p>For they not only called us "Dogs!" and cried out "<i>Usance</i>
<i>de la mar</i>," which is as much as to say, "The fortune of the
wars!" but attempted to tear up the planks, setting a work
hammers, hatchets, knives, the oars of the boat, boat-hook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
their curtleaxes, and what else came to hand; besides stones
and bricks in the Cook Room: all which they threw amongst
us; attempting still and still, to break and rip up the hatches
and boards of the steering, not desisting from their former
execrations, and horrid blasphemies and revilings.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> perceived them so violent, and
understood how the slaves had cleared the decks of all the
Turks and Moors beneath; he set a guard upon the powder,
and charged their own muskets against them: killing them
from divers scout holes, both before and behind; and so
lessened their number, to the joy of all our hearts.</p>

<p>Whereupon they cried out, and called for the Pilot: and
so <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, with some to guard him, went to them; and
understood them, by their kneeling, that they cried for mercy
and to have their lives saved; and they would come down;
which he bade them do. And so they were taken one by one,
and bound; yea, killed with their own curtleaxes. Which,
when the rest perceived, they called us, "English dogs!"
and reviled us with many opprobrious terms; some leaping
overboard, saying, "It was the chance of war!" Some were
manacled, and so thrown overboard: and some were slain
and mangled with the curtleaxes; till the ship was well
cleared, and ourselves assured of the victory.</p>

<p>At the first report of our piece, and the hurly burly in the
decks; the Captain was writing in his cabin: and hearing
the noise, thought it some strange accident; and so, came
out with his curtleaxe in his hand, presuming by his authority
to pacify the mischief.</p>

<p>But when he cast his eyes upon us, and saw that we were
like to surprise the ship; he threw down his curtleaxe, and
begged to save his life: intimating to <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>, "how he had
redeemed him from <span class="smcap">Villa Rise</span>; and ever since admitted
him to place of command in the ship; besides honest usage
in the whole course of the voyage."</p>

<p>All which <span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> confessed; and at last, condescended
[<i>agreed</i>] to mercy: and brought the Captain and five more into
England.</p>

<p>The Captain was called <span class="smcap">Ramtham Rise</span>; but his Christian
name, <span class="smcap">Henry Chandler</span>: and, as they say, a chandler's
son in Southwark. <span class="smcap">John Goodale</span> was also an English
Turk. <span class="smcap">Richard Clarke</span>, in Turkish, <span class="smcap">Jafar</span>; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span><span class="smcap">George Cooke,</span>
<span class="smcap">Ramedam</span>; <span class="smcap">John Browne</span>, <span class="smcap">Mamme</span>; <span class="smcap">William Winter</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mustapha</span>: besides all the slaves and Hollanders; with
other Renegadoes, who were willing to be reconciled to their
true Saviour, as being formerly seduced with the hopes of
riches, honour preferment, and such like devilish baits to
catch the souls of mortal men and entangle frailty in the
tarriers of horrible abuses and imposturing deceit.</p>

<p>When all was done, and the ship cleared of the dead
bodies; <span class="smcap">John Rawlins</span> assembled his men together, and
with one consent gave the praise to GOD: using the accustomed
Service on ship board: and, for want of books,
lifted up their voices to GOD, as He put into their hearts or
renewed their memories. Then, did they sing a <i>Psalm</i>; and,
last of all, embraced one another, for playing the men in such
a deliverance, whereby our fear was turned into joy, and
trembling hearts exhilarated; that we had escaped such inevitable
dangers, and especially the slavery and terror of
bondage, worse than death itself!</p>

<p>The same night, we washed our ship, put everything in as
good order as we could, repaired the broken quarter, set up
the biticle, and bore up the helm for England: where, by
GOD's grace and good guiding, we arrived at Plymouth, the
13th of February 1622; and were welcomed like the
recovery of the lost sheep, or as you read of a loving mother
that runneth, with embraces to entertain her son from a long
voyage and escape of many dangers.</p>

<p>Not long after, we understood of our confederates that
returned home in the bark of Torbay, that they arrived in
Penzance in Cornwall, the 11th of February.</p>

<p>And if any ask after their deliverance, considering there
were ten Turks sent to man her, I will tell you that too.</p>

<p>The next day after they lost us [<i>i.e., 7th</i>], as you have
heard, the three Renegadoes had acquainted the Master's
Mate and the two English in her, with <span class="smcap">Rawlins'</span> determination;
and that they themselves would be true to them, and
assist them in any enterprise: then, if the worst came, there
were but seven to six.</p>

<p>But, as it fell out, they had a more easy passage than
turmoil and manslaughter. For they made the Turks believe
the wind was come fair, and that they were sailing to Argier,
till they came within sight of England: which one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
amongst the rest discovered, saying plainly, "that land was
not like Cape St. Vincent!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" saith he that was at the helm, "and [<i>if</i>] you will
be contented, and go down into the hold; and turn the salt
over to windward, whereby the ship may bear full sail: you
shall know and see more to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Whereupon five of them went down very orderly, the
Renegadoes feigning themselves asleep; who presently start
up, and with the help of the two English, nailed down the
hatches. Whereat the principal amongst them much repined;
and began to grow into choler and rage, had it not
quickly been overpassed. For one stepped to him, and dashed
out his brains; and threw him overboard.</p>

<p>The rest were brought to Exeter: either to be arraigned
according to the punishment of delinquents in that kind, or
disposed of as the King and Council shall think meet.</p>

<p>And this is the story of this Deliverance, and end of <span class="smcap">John</span>
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span>'s voyage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, gentle Reader! I hope you will not call in question
the power and goodness of GOD, who, from time to time,
extendeth His mercy to the miraculous preservation of His
servants; nor make any doubt that He hath still the same
arm and vigour as He had in times past, when <span class="smcap">Gideon</span>'s three
hundred men overcame the Midianites: and many ancient
stratagems are recorded to have had a passage of success,
even within our memories, to execute as great a wonder as
this. Nor do I think you will be startled at anything in the
discourse touching the cruelty and inhumanity of Turks and
Moors themselves: who, from a native barbarousness, do hate
all Christians and Christianity; especially if they grow into
the violent rages of piracy, or fall into that exorbitant course
of selling of slaves, or enforcing of men to be Mahomedans.</p>

<p>Nor can I imagine, you will call in question our natural
desire of liberty, and saving of our lives, when you see, from
instinct of nature, all the creatures of the world come to the
law of preservation: and our Saviour Himself, alloweth the flying
out of one city into another, in the time of persecution; and
<span class="smcap">Paul</span>, by saying "He was a Roman!" procured his delivery.</p>

<p>Well, then, it is only the truth of the story that you are
amazed at: making doubt whether your belief of the same
may be bestowed to your own credit! I can say no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
The actors in this comic tragedy are most of them alive.
The Turks are in prison! the ship is to be seen! and
<span class="smcap">Rawlins</span> himself dare justify the matter! For he hath presented
it to the Marquis! a man not to be dallied withal in
these things; nor any way to be made partaker of deceit.</p>

<p>Nay, I protest I think he durst not, for his ears! publish
(concerning the substance) such a discourse to open overlooking,
if it were not true! As for illustration, or cementing
the broken pieces of well-tempered mortar, blame him not in
that! For precious stones are worn enamelled and wrought
in gold; which otherwise would still be of value and estimation;
but published and receiving the addition of art and
cunning, who doth not account [them] the better, and
esteemeth himself the ruler for their possession.</p>

<p>So, then, entertain it for a true and certain discourse!
Apply it! make use of it! and put it to thy heart for thy
comfort! It teacheth the acknowledgment of a powerful,
provident, and merciful GOD, who will be known in His
wonders, and make weak things the instruments of His glory!
It instructeth us in the practice of thanksgiving when a
a benefit is bestowed, a mercy shown, and a deliverance
perfected. It maketh us strong and courageous in adversity,
like cordial restoratives to a sick heart; and our patience
shall stand like a rock, against the impetuous assaults of
affliction. It is a glorious sun to dissipate the clouds of
desperation; and cheer us thus far that GOD can restore us,
when we are under the pressure of discomfort and tribulation:
for preferment comes neither from the East, nor the West;
but from Him that holdeth the winds in His hands, and puts
a hook in the nostrils of Leviathan.</p>

<p>So that if He do not give way to our contentment, it is because
He will supply us with better graces, or keep us from
the adder's hole of Temptation, whereat, if we tarry, we shall
be sure to be stung unto death.</p>

<p>In a word, it is a Mirror to look Virtue in the face! and
teach men the way to industry and noble performances; that
a brave spirit and honest man shall say, with <span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span>,
"<i>Shall such a man as I! fly?</i> Shall I fear death or some
petty trial; when GOD is to be honoured! my country to be
served! my King to be obeyed! Religion to be defended!
the Commonwealth supported! honour and renown obtained!
and, in the end, the crown of immortality purchased?"</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><i><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Morgan</span> drew up the following Relation,</i>

<i>assist the French against the Spaniards; and thought the Right</i>
<i>they did their country, by their behaviour, might make some</i>
<i>amends for the Occasion of their being in that service.</i></p>

<p><i>It had been printed in the last reign</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, of <span class="smcap">James II.</span>], <i>if the
Authority of it had not interposed, because there was not so much
said of some who were <span class="antiqua">then</span> in the Spanish army, as they expected:
and is published now, to let the world see that more was owing
to our country than either Monsieur <span class="smcap">Bussy Rabutin</span></i> [<span class="smcap">Roger</span>

<i><span class="smcap">[Edmund] Ludlow</span></i> (Part II. <i>p.</i> 561), <i>in their</i> Memoirs
<i>do allow. The former by his manner of expression seems</i>
<i>contented with an opportunity to lessen their merit; and being</i>
<i>in the right wing of the French, while this passed in the left,</i>
<i>comes under the just reflection he himself makes</i> (Part II. <i>p.</i> 139)
<i>a little after, upon the Describers of Fights, who are particular</i>
<i>in what they did not see: and whether the latter was misinformed,</i>
<i>or swayed by his prejudice</i> (Part II. <i>p.</i> 496) <i>to those</i>

<p><i>It may not be improper to add, that these papers came to the</i>

<i>written: and to whom Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Morgan</span> confirmed every</i>

<i>may be urged for the credit of the narrative, since Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas</span></i>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> French King, and his Eminence the
Cardinal <span class="smcap">Mazarin</span> came to view the Six
Thousand English, near Charleroi; and
ordered Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> with the
said Six Thousand English, to march and
make conjunction with Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s
army: who, soon after the conjunction,
beleaguered a town called St. Venant, on
the borders of Flanders.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> having invested the town on the east
side, and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> with his Six Thousand
English and a Brigade of French Horse on the west; the
army encamped betwixt Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s approaches [<i>lines</i>
<i>or parallels</i>] and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>'s. And being to
relieve Count <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span> out of the approaches of the west
side of the town, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> marched into the
approaches, with 800 English. The English, at that time,
being strangers in approaches, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
instructed the Officers and soldiers to take their place, by
fifties; that thereby they might relieve the Point, to carry
on the approaches, every hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, whilst we besieged the town; the enemy
had beleaguered a town called Ardres [<i>p.</i> <a href="#Page_183">183</a>], within five
miles of Calais.</p>

<p>In the evening, Count <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span>, with six Noblemen,
came to the Point, to see how Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
carried on his approaches; but there happened a little
confusion, by the soldiers intermingling themselves in the
approaches, so as there was never an entire fifty, to be called
to the Point.</p>

<p>Count <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span> and his Noblemen taking notice thereof;
Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was much troubled, leaped upon the
Point, and called out fifty to "take up the spades, pickaxes,
and fascines, and follow him." But so it happened, that all
[<i>i.e., the 800</i>] in the approaches leapt out after him; the
enemy, in the meantime, firing as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, conceiving his loss in bringing
them to their approaches would be greater than in carrying
them forward, passed over a channel of water on which there
was a bridge and a turnpike, and the soldiers crying out,
"Fall on! Fall on!" he fell upon the Counterscarp, beat the
enemy from it and three Redoubts: which caused them to
capitulate; and, the next morning, to surrender the town,
and receive a French garrison. So as the sudden reduction,
thereof, gave Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> an opportunity, afterwards,
to march and relieve Ardres.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next place, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> besieged, was Mardyke;
taken, in twice eight and forty hours, by the English
and French. After the taking thereof, Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was settled there; by the order of the French King
and <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>, with 2,000 English and 1,000 French, in order
to the beleaguering Dunkirk, the next Spring. The rest of
the English were quartered at Borborch [<i>Bourbough</i>].</p>

<p>For the space of four months, there was hardly a week
wherein Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> had not two or three alarms
by the Spanish army. He answered to them all; and never
went out of his clothes all the winter, except to change his
shirt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next Spring [1658], Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> beleaguered
Dunkirk on the Newport side; and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span></span>
on the Mardyke side, with his Six Thousand English, and a
Brigade of French Horse. He made a bridge over the
canal betwixt that and Bergen, that there might be communication
betwixt Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s camp and his.</p>

<p>When Dunkirk was close invested, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> sent
a summons to the Governor, the Marquis <span class="smcap">de Leida</span>, a great
Captain, and brave defender of a siege: but the summons
being answered with defiance, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> immediately
broke ground; and carried on the approaches on his side,
whilst the English did the same, on theirs. And it is
observable, the English had two miles to march every day,
upon relieving their approaches.</p>

<p>In this manner the approaches were carried on, both by
the French and English, for the space of twelve nights:
when the Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> had intelligence that the Prince
<span class="smcap">de Cond&eacute;</span>, the Duke of <span class="smcap">York</span> [<i>afterwards, <span class="smcap">James II.</span></i>], Don
<span class="smcap">John</span> of <span class="smcap">Austria</span>, and the Prince <span class="smcap">de Ligny</span> were at the head
of 30,000 horse and foot, with resolution to relieve Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Immediately upon this intelligence, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
and several Noblemen of France went to the King and
Cardinal, at Mardyke; acquainted his Eminence therewith,
and desired His Majesty and his Eminence the Cardinal to
withdraw their persons into safety, and leave their orders.</p>

<p>His Majesty answered that "He knew no better place of
safety than at the head of his army;" but said, "It was
convenient the Cardinal should withdraw to Calais."</p>

<p>Then Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> and the Noblemen made answer,
"They could not be satisfied, except His Majesty withdrew
himself into safety." Which was assented to; and the King
and Cardinal marching to Calais, left open orders with
Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> that "If the enemy came on; to give
battle or raise the siege, as he should be advised by a Council
of War."</p>

<p>The enemy came on to Bruges, and then Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
thought it high time to call a Council of War; which consisted
of eight Noblemen, eight Lieutenant-Generals, and
six <i>Mareschaux de Camp</i>: but never sent to [the English]
Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span>, or Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>.</p>

<p>The whole sense of the Council of War was that "It was
great danger to the Crown of France to hazard a battle in
that strait [<i>broken</i>] country, full of canals and ditches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
water." And several reasons being shown to that purpose,
it ran through the Council of War, "to raise the siege, if the
enemy came on."</p>

<p>Within half an hour after the Council of War was risen,
Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> had the result of it in his camp;
and went immediately to Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> to know if
he had heard anything of it?</p>

<p>He said, "He had heard nothing of it"; and complained
that "he was much afflicted with the stone, gravel, and some
other impediments."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> asked him "to go with him, the
next morning, to the headquarters."</p>

<p>He said, "He would, if he were able."</p>

<p>Next morning, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> sent a Nobleman to
Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span>, and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>; to
desire them to come to a second Council of War.</p>

<p>Immediately, therefore, Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> and
Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> went with the Nobleman to Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s camp: and, by that time they came there, the
Council of War was ready to sit down in Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s
tent.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> satisfied the Council of War that "He
had forgot to send for Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> and Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> to the first Council of War; and therefore
thought fit to call this, that they might be satisfied!" and
then put the question, "Whether if the enemy came on, he
should make good the siege on the Newport side, and give
them battle: or raise the siege?" and required they should
give their reasons for either.</p>

<p>The <i>Marcsehaux de Camp</i> ran away with it [<i>i.e., the idea</i>],
clearly to raise the siege; alleging what danger it was to
the Crown of France to hazard a battle, within so strait a
country, full of canals and ditches of water: further alleging
that if the enemy came upon the Bank, they would cut
between Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>'s
camps, and prevent their conjunction.</p>

<p>Two of the Lieutenant-Generals ran along with the
<i>Mareschaux de Camp</i>; and shewed the same reasons.</p>

<p>But Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> (finding that it was high time
to speak, and that otherwise it would go round the board
[<i>table</i>]) rose up, and desired, though out of course, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
might declare his mind in opposition to what the <i>Mareschaux</i>
<i>de Camp</i> and the two Lieutenant-Generals had declared.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> told him, "He should have freedom to
speak his thoughts."</p>

<p>Then Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> spoke, and said that "The
reasons the <i>Mareschaux de Camp</i> and the two Lieutenant-Generals
had given for raising the siege, were no reasons:
for the straitness of the country was as good for the French
and English as for the enemy." And whereas they had
alleged that "If the enemy came on the Bank between
Furnes and Dunkirk, they would cut between Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>'s camps." Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> replied, "It was impossible, for they could
not march upon the Bank above eight a breast; and that
Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s artillery and small shot would cut them
off at pleasure." He added, "That was not the way, the
enemy could relieve Dunkirk! but that they would make a
bridge of boats over the channel in an hour and a half; and
cross their army on to the sands of Dunkirk, to offer Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span> battle." Further, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> did
allege, "What a dishonour it would be to the Crown of
France! to have summoned the city of Dunkirk, and broke
ground before it, and run away! And he desired the Council
of War would consider that, if they raised the siege, the
alliance with England would be broken the same hour."</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> answered that, "If he thought the
enemy would offer that fair game; he would maintain the
siege on the Newport side; and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
should march, and make conjunction with the French army,
and leave the Mardyke side open."</p>

<p>Upon Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s reply, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
did rise from the board, and, upon his knees, begged a battle;
and said that "he would venture the Six Thousand English,
every soul!"</p>

<p>Upon which, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> consulted the Noblemen
that sat next to him; and it was desired that Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> might walk a turn or two without the tent; and he
should be called immediately.</p>

<p>After he had walked two turns, he was called in. As
soon as he came in, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> said that "He had
considered his reasons; and that himself and the Council of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
War resolved to give battle to the enemy, if they came on;
and to maintain the siege on the Newport side: and that
Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was to make conjunction with the
French army."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> then said, "That, with GOD's
assistance, we should be able to deal with them!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The very next day, at four in the afternoon, the Spanish
army had made a bridge of boats, crossed their army on the
sands of Dunkirk, and drew up into <i>battalia</i> [line of battle],
within two miles of Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s lines; before he
knew anything of them.</p>

<p>Immediately, all the French horse drew out to face the
enemy at a mile's distance; and Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> sent
immediate orders to Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> to march into
his camp, with the Six Thousand English and the French
Brigade of Horse. Which was done accordingly.</p>

<p>The next day, about eight o'clock, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> gave
orders to break avenues on both the lines, that the army
might march out in <i>battalia</i>.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> set his soldiers to break avenues,
for their marching out in <i>battalia</i> likewise. Several Officers
being with him, as he was looking on his soldiers at work;
Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> comes up, with a white cap on his
head, and said to Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, "You see what
condition I am in! I am not able to give you any assistance
this day! You are the older soldier, and the greatest part
of the work of this day must lie upon your soldiers!"
Upon which, the Officers smiled. So he bade "GOD be with
us!" and went away with the Lieutenant-General of the
Horse, that was upon our left wing. From which time, we
never saw him till we were in pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p>When the avenues were cleared, both the French and
English armies marched out of the lines towards the enemy.</p>

<p>We were forced to march up in four lines [? <i>columns</i>] (for
we had not room enough to wing [? <i>spread out into line</i>] for
the canal between Furnes and Dunkirk, and the sea) till we
had marched above half a mile.</p>

<p>Then we came to a halt on rising hills of sand; and having
more room took in [? <i>spread out</i>] two of our lines.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> seeing the enemy plain, in <i>battalia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
said, before the head of the army, "See, yonder are the
gentlemen you have to trade withal!"</p>

<p>Upon which, the whole Brigade of English gave a shout
of rejoicing, that made a roaring echo betwixt the sea and
the canal.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> came up, with above a
hundred Noblemen, to know what was the matter, and the
reason of that great shout?</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> told him, "It was a usual custom
of the redcoats, when they saw the enemy, to rejoice."</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> answered, "They were men of brave
resolution and courage."</p>

<p>After which, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> returning to the head of
his army; we put on to our march again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the second halt, the whole Brigade of English gave a
shout, and cast up their caps into the air; saying, "They
would have better hats before night!"</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, upon that shout, came up again, with
several Noblemen and Officers of the army, admiring the
resolution of the English, at which time, we were within
three-quarters of a mile of the enemy in <i>battalia</i>.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> desired Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> that, at
the next halt, he would keep even front with the French; for
says he, "I do intend to halt at some distance, that we may
see how the enemy is drawn up; and take our advantage
accordingly."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> demanded of his Excellency,
"Whether he would shock the whole army at one dash; or
try one wing first?"</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s reply was, "That as to that question,
he could not resolve him yet, till he came nearer the enemy."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> desired the Marshal, "not to let
him languish for orders!" saying that "oftentimes opportunities
are often lost, for want of orders in due time."</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> said, "He would either come himself,
and give orders; or send a Lieutenant-General."</p>

<p>And so Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> parted, and went to the head of
his army.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> gave orders to
the Colonels and Leading Officers [<i>i.e., Captains and Lieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>tenants</i>],
to have a special care that, when the French came
to a halt, they kept even front with them: and further told
them, that, "if they could not observe the French, they
should take notice when he lifted up his hat," for he marched
still above three score [yards] before the centre of the Bodies.</p>

<p>But when the French came to halt, it so happened that
the English pressed upon their Leading Officers, so that
they came up under the shot of the enemy; but when they
saw that Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was in a passion, they put
themselves to a stand. Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> could soon
have remedied their forwardness, but he was resolved that he
would not lose one foot of ground he had advanced; but
would hold it as long as he could.</p>

<p>We were so near the enemy, the soldiers fell into great
friendship. One asking, "Is such an Officer in your army?"
Another, "Is such a soldier in yours?" And this passed
on both sides.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> endured this friendship for a little
while; and then came up to the centre of the Bodies, and
demanded, "How long that friendship would continue?"
and told them further that "for anything they knew, they
would be cutting one another's throats within a minute of
an hour!"</p>

<p>The whole Brigade answered, "Their friendship should
continue no longer than he pleased!"</p>

<p>Then Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> bade them tell the enemy,
"No more friendship! Prepare your buff coats and scarfs!
for we will be with you, sooner than you expect us!"</p>

<p>Immediately after the friendship was broke, the enemy
poured a volley of shot into one of our battalions, wounded
three or four and one dropped.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Major-General immediately sent the Adjutant-General
to Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, for orders; "Whether he should
charge the enemy's right wing, or whether Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
would engage the enemy's left wing?" and advised the
Adjutant-General not to stay, but to acquaint Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span> that we were under the enemy's shot, and had
received some prejudice already.</p>

<p>But there was no return of the Adjutant-General, nor
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span></p>

<p>By-and-by, the enemy poured in another volley of shot
into another of our battalions; and wounded two or three.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> (observing the enemy mending
faults, and opening the intervals of the Foot to bring the
Horse in, which would have made our work more difficult)
called all the Colonels and Officers of the Field [<i>Field</i>
<i>Officers, as distinguished from Leading Officers</i>], together
before the centre of the Bodies, and told them, "He had
sent the Adjutant-General for orders; but when he saw there
was no hope of orders, he told them, if they would concur
with him, he would immediately charge the enemy's right
wing."</p>

<p>Their answer was, "They were ready, whenever he gave
orders."</p>

<p>He told them, "He would try the right wing with the
Blue Regiment, and the 400 Firelocks which were in the
intervals of the French Horse;" and wished all the Field
Officers to be ready at their several posts.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> gave orders that "The other five
Regiments should not move from their ground; except they
saw the Blue Regiment, the White, and the 400 Firelocks
shock the enemy's right wing right off the ground:" and
further shewed the several Colonels, what Colours they were
to charge; and told them moreover that, "If he were not
knocked on the head, he would come to them."</p>

<p>In like manner, as fast as he could, he admonished the
whole Brigade; and told them, "They were to look in the
face of an enemy who had violated and endeavoured to take
away their reputation; and that they had no other way but
to fight it out to the last man! or to be killed, taken prisoner,
or drowned!" And further, that "The honour of England
did depend much upon their gallantry and resolution that
day!"</p>

<p>The enemy's wing was posted on a sandy hill, and had
cast the sand breast-high before them.</p>

<p>Then Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> did order the Blue Regiment
and the 400 Firelocks to advance to the Charge. In the
meantime, knowing the enemy would all bend upon them
that did advance; he removed the White Regiment more to
the right, that it might be in the flank of them by that time,
the Blue Regiment was got within push of pike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span></p>

<p>His Royal Highness, the Duke of <span class="smcap">York</span>, with a select
party of Horse, had got into the Blue Regiment, by that
time the White came in, and exposed his person to great
danger. But we knew nobody at that time.</p>

<p>Immediately, the enemy were clear shocked off their
ground; and the English Colours flying over their heads,
the strongest Officers and soldiers clubbing them down.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, when he saw his opportunity,
stepped to the other five Regiments, which were within six
score [yards] of him; and ordered them to advance and
charge immediately.</p>

<p>But when they came within ten pikes' length, the enemy
perceiving they were not able to endure our charge, shaked
their hats, held up their handkerchiefs, and called for
"Quarter!"</p>

<p>But the Redcoats cried aloud, "They had not leisure for
Quarter!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the enemy faced about, and would not endure
our charge; but fell to run: having the English Colours
over their heads, and our strongest soldiers and Officers
clubbing them down. So that the Six Thousand English
carried ten or twelve thousand Horse and Foot before them.</p>

<p>The French army was about musket shot in the rear of
us, where they came [<i>had come</i>] to a halt; and never moved
off their ground.</p>

<p>The rest of the Spanish army, seeing the right wing carried
away, and the English Colours flying over their heads,
wheeled about in as good order as they could. So that we
had the whole Spanish army before us! and Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> called out to the Colonels, "To the right! as much
as you can!" that so, we might have all the enemy's army
under the English Colours.</p>

<p>The Six Thousand English carried all the Spanish army
[before it] as far as from Westminster Abbey to St. Paul's
Churchyard, before ever a Frenchman came in, on either
wing of us. But then, at last, we could perceive the French
Horse come powdering [<i>scattered</i>] on each wing with much
gallantry: but they never struck one stroke; and only carried
prisoners back to the camp.</p>

<p>Neither, did we ever see the Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> till we
were in pursuit of the enemy; and then, we could see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
amongst us, very brisk; without his white cap on his head,
and neither troubled with gravel or stone.</p>

<p>When we were at the end of the pursuit, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
and above a hundred Officers of the army came up to us,
quitted their horses, embraced the Officers, and said, "They
never saw a more glorious action in their lives! and that
they were so transported with the sight of it, that they had no
power to move, or to do anything." And this high compliment,
we had for our pains! In a word, the French army did not
strike one stroke in the battle of Dunkirk; only the Six
Thousand English!</p>

<p>After we had done pursuing the enemy, Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> rallied his forces, and marched over the sands
to where he had shocked them at first, to see what slaughter
there was made. But Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span> went into the
camp as fast as he could, to write his letters for England,
of what great service he had done! which was just nothing!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> brought
the armies close to invest Dunkirk again, and to carry on the
approaches.</p>

<p>The Marquis <span class="smcap">de Leida</span> happened to be in the Counterscarp,
and received an accidental shot, whereof he died:
and the whole garrison, being discouraged at his death, came
to capitulate in a few days.</p>

<p>So the town was surrendered, and Ambassador <span class="smcap">Lockhart</span>
marched into it, with two Regiments of English for a
garrison: but Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> kept the field with
Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, with his other four Regiments of
English.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next siege was Bergen St. Winock, six miles from
Dunkirk; which Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> beleaguered with the
French army, and the four Regiments of English: and, in
four or five days' siege, it was taken upon capitulation.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> did rest the army for two days after;
and then resolved to march through the heart of Flanders,
and take what towns he could, that campaign.</p>

<p>The next town he took was Furnes, the next Menin; after
that, Oudenarde: and, in a word, eight towns besides Dunkirk
and Ypres. For so soon as the Redcoats came near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
counterscarps, there was nothing but a capitulation, and a
surrender presently. All the towns we took were towns of
strength [<i>i.e., fortified</i>].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last siege we made, was before the city of Ypres,
where the Prince <span class="smcap">de Ligny</span> had cast himself in before, for
the defence of that city, with 2,500 Horse and Dragoons.
Besides, there were in the city, 4,000 burghers, all proper
young men, under their arms. So that the garrison did
consist of 6,500 men.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> sent in a summons; which was
answered by a defiance.</p>

<p>Then Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> broke ground, and carried on two
approaches towards the Counterscarp. Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
went into the approaches every night, for fear of any miscarriage
by the English; and came out of the approaches
every morning at sunrising, to take his rest: for then the
soldiers had done working.</p>

<p>The fourth morning, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> went to take
his rest in his tent; but, within half an hour afterwards,
Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> sent a Nobleman to him, to desire him to
come to speak with him. When the Major-General came,
there were above a hundred Noblemen and Officers of the
army walking about his tent. And his Gentlemen had decked
a room for his Excellency with his sumpter cloths; in which
homely place, there were about twenty Officers of the army
with him: but as soon as Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> came,
Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> desired all of them to retire, for he had
something to communicate to the Major-General.</p>

<p>The room was immediately cleared, and Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
turned the Gentlemen of his Chamber out, and shut the
door himself. When this was done, he desired the Major-General
to sit down by him; and the first news that he spake
of was that "he had certain intelligence that the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Cond&eacute;</span> and Don <span class="smcap">Juan</span> of <span class="smcap">Austria</span> were at the head of 11,000
Horse and 4,000 Foot, within three leagues of this camp: and
resolved to break through one of our quarters, to relieve the
city of Ypres," and therefore he desired Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> to have all the English, under their arms, every
night, at sunset; and the French army should be so likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span></p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> replied, and said, "The Prince of
<span class="smcap">Cond&eacute;</span> and Don <span class="smcap">Juan</span> of Austria were great Captains; and
that they might dodge with Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, to fatigue
his army:" and, further, that "If he did keep the army three
nights to that hard shift, they would not care who did knock
them on the head!"</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> replied, "We must do it, and surmount
all difficulty!"</p>

<p>The Major-General desired to know of his Excellency,
"Whether he was certain, the enemy was so near him?"</p>

<p>He answered, "He had two spies just come from them."</p>

<p>Then Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> told him, "His condition
was somewhat desperate!" and said that "A desperate
disease must have a desperate cure!"</p>

<p>His Excellency asked, "What he meant?"</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> did offer him, to attempt the
Counterscarp upon [<i>by</i>] an assault; and so put all things out
of doubt, with expedition.</p>

<p>The Major-General had no sooner said this; but Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span> joined his hands, and looked up, through the boards,
towards the heavens, and said, "Did ever my Master, the
King of France, or the King of Spain attempt a Counterscarp
upon an assault: where there were three Half Moons
covered with cannon, and the ramparts of the town playing
point blank into the Counterscarp?"</p>

<p>Further, he said, "What will the King, my Master, say
of me, if I expose his army to these hazards?" And he rose
up, and fell into a passion, stamping with his feet, and shaking
his locks, and grinning with his teeth, he said, "Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> had made him mad!"</p>

<p>But, by degrees, he cooled, and asked the Major-General,
"Whether he would stay to dinner with him?"</p>

<p>But the Major-General begged his pardon, for he had appointed
some of the Officers to eat a piece of beef at his tent
that day.</p>

<p>His Excellency asked him, "If he would meet him at two
o'clock, at the opening of the approaches?"</p>

<p>The Major-General said, "He would be punctual, but
desired he would bring none of his train with him (for it was
usually a hundred Noblemen with their feathers and ribands);
because if he did, he would have no opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
take a view of the Counterscarp: for the enemy would discover
them, and fire incessantly."</p>

<p>His Excellency said, "He would bring none but two or three
of the Lieutenant-Generals."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was at the place appointed, a
quarter of an hour before his Excellency: who then came
with eight Noblemen, and three Lieutenant-Generals, and
took a place to view the Counterscarp.</p>

<p>After he had looked a considerable time upon it; he turned
about, and looked upon the Noblemen and Lieutenant-Generals
and said, "I don't know what to say to you! Here
is Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> has put me out of my wits! for
he would have me attempt yonder Counterscarp upon an
assault."</p>

<p>None of the Noblemen or Lieutenant-Generals made any
reply to him; but Count <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span>, who said, "My Lord!
I think Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> would offer nothing to your
Lordship, but what he thinks feasible: and he knows he has
good fighting men."</p>

<p>Upon this, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> asked, "How many English
he would venture?"</p>

<p>The Major-General said, "He would venture 600 common
men, besides Officers; and fifty pioneers."</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> said, "600 of Monsieur <span class="smcap">la Fert&eacute;</span>'s
army and 50 Pioneers; and 600 of his own army and 50
Pioneers more, would make better [<i>more</i>] than 2,000 men."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> replied, "They were abundance
to carry it, with GOD's assistance."</p>

<p>Then his Excellency said, "He would acquaint the King
and his Eminence that Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> had put him
upon that desperate design."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> desired his pardon, "For it was
in his [<i>the Marshal's</i>] power to attempt it, or not to attempt
it."</p>

<p>But in the close, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> said to the Major-General
that "He must fall into Monsieur <span class="smcap">la Fert&eacute;</span>'s
approaches, and that he should take the one half of Monsieur
<span class="smcap">la Fert&eacute;</span>'s men; and that he would take the other half
into his own approaches."</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> begged his pardon, and said "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
desired to fall on with the English entire by themselves,
without intermingling them."</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> replied, "He must fall on out of one of
the approaches!"</p>

<p>The Major-General replied that "He would fall on in the
plain between both approaches."</p>

<p>His Excellency said that "He would never be able to
endure their firing; but that they would kill half his men
before he could come to the Counterscarp."</p>

<p>The Major-General said that "He had an invention, that
the enemy should not perceive him, till he had his hands
upon the stockadoes."</p>

<p>Next, his Excellency said, "For the signal, there shall be
a captain of Monsieur <span class="smcap">la Fert&eacute;</span>'s, with 20 Firelocks: who
shall leap upon the Point, and cry, <i>Sa! Sa! Vive le Roi de</i>
<i>France!</i>" and upon that noise all were to fall on together.</p>

<p>But Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> opposed that signal, saying,
"The enemy would thereby be alarmed, and then he should
hardly endure their firing."</p>

<p>His Excellency replied then, that "He would give no signal
at all! but the Major-General should give it!" and he would
not be persuaded otherwise.</p>

<p>Then the Major-General desired his Excellency that he
would give order to them in the approaches, to keep themselves
in readiness against sunset; for at the shutting of the
night he would fall on. He likewise desired his Excellency
that he would order a Major out of his own approaches, and
another out of Monsieur <span class="smcap">la Fert&eacute;</span>'s approaches to stand by
him, and when he should be ready to fall on, he would
despatch the two Majors into each of the approaches, that
they might be ready to leap out when the Major-General
passed between the two approaches with the commanded
English.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just at sunset, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> came himself, and told
the Major-General "He might fall on, when he saw his own
time."</p>

<p>The Major-General replied, "He would fall on just at
the setting of the night, and when the dusk of the evening
came on."</p>

<p>The Major-General made the English stand to their arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
and divided them into Bodies; a Captain at the head of the
Pioneers, and the Major-General and a Colonel at the head
of the two Battalions.</p>

<p>He ordered the two battalions and the pioneers, each man,
to take up a long fascine upon their muskets and pikes; and
then, they were three small groves of wood!</p>

<p>Immediately the Major-General commanded the two
Majors to go to their approaches; and that they should leap
out so soon as they should see the Major-General march
between their approaches, and did order the two battalions
that when they came within three score [yards] of the
stockadoes to slip [off] their fascines, and fall on.</p>

<p>But it so happened that the French never moved out of
their approaches, till such time as Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>
had overpowered the enemy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Pioneers came within sight of the stockadoes,
they slipped the fascines down, and fell on: the Major-General
and the two battalions were close to them. When
the soldiers began to lay their hands on the stockadoes they
tore them down, for the length of six score [yards]; and
leaped pell mell into the Counterscarp amongst the enemy.
Abundance of the enemy were drowned in the moat; and
many taken prisoners, with two German Princes; and the
Counterscarp cleared.</p>

<p>The French were in their approaches all this time. Then,
the English fell on upon the Half Moons; and immediately
the Redcoats were on the top of them; throwing the enemy
into the moat, and turning the cannon upon the town. Thus
the two Half Moons were speedily taken.</p>

<p>After the manning of the Half Moons, he did rally all
the English, with intention to lodge them upon the Counterscarp,
that he might be free of the enemy's shot the next
morning. And they left the other Half Moon for Marshal
<span class="smcap">Turenne</span>'s party, which was even before their approaches.</p>

<p>Then the French fell on upon the other Half Moon; but
were beaten off.</p>

<p>The Major-General considered that that Half Moon would
gall him in the day time, and, therefore, did speak to the
Officers and soldiers, that "it were best to give them a little
help."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<p>The Redcoats cried, "Shall we fall on in order, or happy-go-lucky."</p>

<p>The Major-General said, "In the name of GOD! at it,
happy-go-lucky!" And immediately the Redcoats fell on,
and were on the top of it, knocking the enemy down, and
casting them into the moat.</p>

<p>When this work was done the Major-General lodged the
English on the Counterscarp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were no sooner lodged, but Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
scrambled over the ditches to find out the Major-General; and
when he met with him, he was much troubled the French did
no better; for, indeed, they did just nothing!</p>

<p>Then his Excellency asked the Major-General to "go to
his approaches to refresh himself."</p>

<p>But the Major-General begged his pardon, and said, "He
would not stir from his post, till he heard a drum beat a
parley, and saw a white flag over the walls."</p>

<p>Upon that, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> laughed and smiled, and
said, "They would not be at that pass, in six days! and
then went to his approaches, and sent the Major-General
three or four dozen of rare wine, with several dishes of cold
meat and sweetmeats."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within two hours after sunrising, a drum beat a parley,
and a white flag was seen over the walls.</p>

<p>The Major-General ordered a Lieutenant, with a file of
musketeers, to go and receive the drummer, and to blindfold
him, and to carry him straight to Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> in his
approaches.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> came immediately, with the drummer's
message, to the Major-General; and was much troubled
he would not receive the message, before it came to him.</p>

<p>The Major-General replied that "that was very improper,
his Excellency being upon the place."</p>

<p>The message was to this effect, "That whereas his
Excellency had offered them honourable terms in his summons,
they were now willing to accept of them, provided
they might have their Charter and the privileges of the city
preserved. That they had appointed four of their Commissioners
to treat further with four Commissioners from his
Excellency."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> was pleased to asked the Major-General
"whether he would be one of the Commissioners?"
but the Major-General begged his pardon, and desired that
he might abide at his post till such time as the city was
surrendered up.</p>

<p>Immediately then, his Excellency sent for Count <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span>
and three other Commissioners, and gave them instructions
how to treat with the four Commissioners from the
enemy. Just as Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> was giving the Commissioners
instructions, Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> said "that
the enemy were hungry! so that they would eat any
meat they could have": whereupon his Excellency smiled,
and shortened their instructions, and sent them away.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, the Commissioners had concluded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That they should have their City Charter preserved.
That they were to receive a French garrison in. And
that the Prince <span class="smcap">de Ligny</span> was to march out with all his
forces, next morning, at nine o'clock, with one piece of
cannon, colours flying, bullet in mouth, and match
lighted at both ends; and to have a convoy to conduct
him into his own territories.</p></div>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> was in the morning betimes, with
several Noblemen and Officers of the army, and Major-General
<span class="smcap">Morgan</span> attending near the gate, for the Prince <span class="smcap">de</span>
<span class="smcap">Ligny</span>'s coming out.</p>

<p>The Prince having noticed that Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> was
there, came out of his coach; Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> being
alighted from his horse, and Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>: at
their meeting there was a great acclamation, and embracing
one another.</p>

<p>After a little time, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span> told the Prince "He
very much admired [<i>wondered</i>] that he should expose his
person to a garrison before a conquering army."</p>

<p>The Prince <span class="smcap">de Ligny</span> replied that "If Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>
had left his English in England, he durst have exposed his
person in the weakest garrison the King of Spain had in
Flanders."</p>

<p>So they parted, and his Excellency marched into the town
with a French garrison, and the Major-General with him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So soon as the garrison was settled, Marshal <span class="smcap">Turenne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span></span>
wrote his letters to the French King, and his Eminence the
Cardinal, how that "the city of Ypres was reduced to the
obedience of His Majesty, and that he was possessed of it;
and that Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> was instrumental in that
service, and that the English did wonders!" and sent the
Intendant of the Army with his letters to the King and
Cardinal.</p>

<p>Monsieur <span class="smcap">Tallon</span>, the Intendant, returned back from the
King and Cardinal to the army within eight days, and
brought a compliment to Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> that "the
King and his Eminence the Cardinal did expect to see him
at Paris, when he came to his winter quarters! where there
would be a Cupboard of Plate [<i>i.e., of gold and silver plate</i>]
to attend him."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, instead of going for his Cupboard
of Plate, went for England; and His Majesty of France had
never the kindness to send him his Cupboard of Plate. So
that this is the reward that Major-General <span class="smcap">Morgan</span> had had
from the French King, for all his service in France and
Flanders.</p>

<h3>To the Reader.<br />

<span class="smcap medium">Worthy Gentlemen, and my loving Countrymen</span>,
</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/645m.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Moved</span> by your many and foretasted courtesies, I
am constrained to appear again unto you. True
it is, I have lien long obscured from your sight,
because I received a Kingly entertainment in a
foreign climate, which could not attain to any (though
never so mean [a]) place at home. Yet have I held
up my head within this horizon, and not altogether been
affected elsewhere; since some part of my poor labours
have found favour in the greatest part of Europe, and been
printed in eight most famous cities beyond the seas, viz.:
Paris, Antwerp, Cologne, Nuremburg, Frankfort, Leipsic,
Amsterdam, and Hamburg; yea, and some of them also
authorised under the Emperor's royal privilege.</p>

<p>Yet I must tell you, as I have been a stranger, so have
I again found strange entertainment since my return: especially,
by the opposition of two sorts of people that shroud
themselves under the titles of Musicians.</p>

<p>The first are some simple Cantors or vocal singers; who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
though they seem excellent in their blind Division-making,
are merely ignorant, even in the first elements of Music;
and also in the true order of the mutation of the Hexachord
in the System, which hath been approved by all the learned
and skilful men of Christendom, these 800 years. Yet do
these fellows give their verdict of me behind my back; and
say, [that] what I do "is after the old manner." But I will
speak openly to them, and would have them know, that the
proudest Cantor of them dares not oppose himself face to
face against me.</p>

<p>The second are young men, professors of the Lute, who
vaunt themselves to the disparagement of such as have been
before their time (wherein I myself am a party), that there
never was the like of them. To these men I say little, because
of my love and hope to see some deeds ensue [from] their
brave words. And also [it] being that, here, under their own
noses, hath been published a book in defence of the Viol de
Gamba; wherein not only all other the best and principal
instruments have been abased, but especially the Lute by
name. The words, to satisfy thee, Reader! I have here
thought good to insert; and are as followeth: "From henceforth,
the stately instrument Gambo Viol shall with ease
yield full, various, and deviceful music as the Lute: for here
I protest the trinity of music&mdash;Parts, Passion, and Division&mdash;to
be as gracefully united in the Gambo Viol, as in the
most received instrument that is," &amp;c. Which imputation,
methinks, the learneder sort of musicians ought not to let
pass unanswered.</p>

<p>Moreover there are here, and daily doth come into our most
famous kingdom, divers strangers from beyond the seas,
which aver before our own faces, that we have no true
method of application or fingering of the Lute.</p>

<p>Now if these gallant young Lutenists be such as they
would have the world believe (and of which I make no doubt)
let them remember that their skill lieth not in their fingers'
ends. <i>Cucullus non facit monachum</i> [<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span><i>A hood does not make a</i>
<i>monk</i>]. I wish for the honour, therefore, and general benefit
of our country, that they would undertake the defence of
their Lute profession; seeing that some of them, above
other, have most large means, convenient time, and such
encouragement as I never knew any have.</p>

<p>Believe me, if any of these objections had been made when
those famous men lived, which are now thought worthy of
no fame; not derogating from these skilful men present, I
dare affirm that these objections had been answered to the
full: and I make no doubt but that those few of the former
time which live yet (being some of them Bachelors of Music;
and others, which assume unto themselves to be no less
worthy) will be as forward to preserve their reputation.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will ask me, why I, that have travelled many
countries and ought to have some experience, do not undergo
this business myself? I answer, that I want ability, being
now entered into the fiftieth year of mine age; secondly, I
want both means, leisure, and encouragement.</p>

<p>But, gentle Reader! to conclude, though abruptly. This
work of mine, which I have here published, containeth such
things as I myself have thought well of, as being, in mine
opinion, furnished with variety of matter, both of judgement
and delight: which willingly I refer to the friendly censure
and approbation of the skilful; hoping it will be no less
delightful to all in general, than it was pleasing to me in
the composition. Farewell.</p>
